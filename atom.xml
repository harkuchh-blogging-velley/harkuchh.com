    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Top level domain which is also abbrebiated as TLD is the very last segment of any domain name, every domain&rsquo;s last part is simply called as TLD. The TLD is the letters immediately following the final dot in an Internet address i.e. any website url, for Instance in Harkuchh.com here .com is TLD of generic class (we will talk about TLD classes below). Most generally TLD is use to identifies something about a website is associated with, like its purpose, the organization that owns it or the geographical area from where it has originates, and every type of TLD has a different registry which is being maintained by a designated organization the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) under the direction of ICANN i.e. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>
To better understand TLD see our Internet address which is, <a href="http://Harkuchh.com">http://Harkuchh.com</a> now here com is the top-level domain name and Harkuchh is the second-level domain name and if a domain has anything even before second level domain then it is called as a subdomain. When these all merge together they build a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) the addition of <a href="HTTP://">HTTP://</a> makes an FQDN a complete URL.</p>

<h2><strong>Four (4) major categories of TLDs</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Generic top-level domains (gTLD)</strong> &mdash; These are the most used, common and familiar type of TLDs. Examples include &ldquo;com&rdquo; for &ldquo;commercial&rdquo;, &ldquo;org&rdquo; for &ldquo;organization&rdquo; and &ldquo;edu&rdquo; for &ldquo;educational.&rdquo; Most generic TLDs are open for everyone to register, but there is a subgroup that is more strictly controlled and that is not used broadly.</p>

<p><strong>Country-code top-level domains (ccTLD)</strong> &mdash; Each ccTLD identifies a particular country and every ccTLD is two letters long, for example we can see the ccTLD for India is .in and for United States is .us.</p>

<p><strong>Infrastructure top-level domain</strong> &mdash; This type is very often used class of TLD may be that is the reason there is only one TLD in this group, ARPA (Address and Routing Parameter Area). The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) manages this TLD for the IETF.</p>

<p><strong>Sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)</strong>: These are overseen by private organizations.</p>

<p>ICANN Proposed an expansion of the TLD system to allow anyone to register and also reserve any spare unused letter sequence as a TLD for Their exclusive use, in April 2009. For example if a company who use to sell sotwares want to to use .Soft as a TLD then they can use it. According to <strong>ICANN chief executive Paul Levins</strong>, Such an extension would lead to thousands of new TLDs in the coming years.</p>

    <link href="http://harkuchh.com/how-to-use-google-like-a-pro-tips-to-use-google-syntax/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-30T21:00:32+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harkuchh.com/how-to-use-google-like-a-pro-tips-to-use-google-syntax</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know you all use Google to reach everywhere on the Internet, but are you using it properly? Google actually provides a specific syntax for searching which is unknown to the masses. Also known as the Google operators, this syntax can make your Googling much easy and much less frustrating.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s specially useful for bloggers since all of us need to keep an eye on the Internet trends. It&rsquo;s very useful to know how to properly use our most used tool, that is Google.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So let&rsquo;s waste less time an look at what Google has to offer for us.</p>

<h1>How to use Google syntax?</h1>

<p>All the search operators described here can be used by putting the operator in the search box followed by the search query. Like to use <strong>related:</strong> operator, following query will be used</p>

<pre><code>related:"harkuchh.com"
</code></pre>

<h2><em>related:</em> Search for related sites</h2>

<pre><code>related:"example.com"
</code></pre>

<p><em>related:</em> is used to search for websites which are similar to the website we provide in search box. When we use this operator, Google will search for any information related to the given website from all over the Internet. Google will show websites which have similar content.</p>

<h2><em>link:</em> Search for all pages that link to a particular url</h2>

<pre><code>link:"http://harkuchh.com/trick-to-copy-content-from-a-website-with-copy-protector-enabled/"
</code></pre>

<p>This operator will search for all the pages that link to the given url.</p>

<h2><em>site:</em> Search within a particular website only</h2>

<pre><code>"site:"harkuchh.com" blogging tips
</code></pre>

<p>Above query will only search &lsquo;harkuchh.com&rsquo; for the words &lsquo;blogging tips&rsquo;. This is a very useful operator. Just imagine when you need to find a particular post you once seen on a website but can&rsquo;t find a link to it. It&rsquo;s one of my most used operators.</p>

<h2>Search for an exact phrase or word</h2>

<p>When we search for a sentence on Google, it doesn&rsquo;t just search for that exact sentence.
Try searching for</p>

<pre><code>I will become dictator of the world
</code></pre>

<p>Google will search for text which have &lsquo;I&rsquo;, &lsquo;will&rsquo;, &lsquo;become&rsquo; etc anywhere on the page. But if we want to only search for pages which contain the complete sentence &ldquo;I will become dictator of the world&rdquo;, we can do it just by putting the whole sentence within quotes. Like this</p>

<pre><code>"I will become dictator of the world"
</code></pre>

<h2>Exclude something in the results</h2>

<p>Sometimes we want that some specific type of results should not appear in the search results. Google provide a special operator just for this purpose.<br/>
That is &lsquo;&ndash;&rsquo;.<br/>
Yes just that. Putting a &lsquo;&ndash;&rsquo; in front of any word will show results which do not have that word in them.
To make it even better, this work with other Google operators as well.</p>

<pre><code>hello lady how are you -season
</code></pre>

<p>Above query if searched without &lsquo;-season&rsquo; will show some youtube results about some seasons of some TV program. But running above query will remove those results which have the word &lsquo;season&rsquo; in them.</p>

    <link href="http://harkuchh.com/trick-to-copy-content-from-a-website-with-copy-protector-enabled/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-29T22:16:18+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harkuchh.com/trick-to-copy-content-from-a-website-with-copy-protector-enabled</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Copy protector is a wordpress plugin which is used by many wordpress sites to stop readers from copying the site content. When you visit a site and find it good to share some part of it, this type of plugins irritate us the most. In these cases, you either share the whole page, or you don&rsquo;t share anything.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are many such plugins which prevent users from copying partial content from a website.
Here we have a solution to this problem.</p>

<p>The solution we are mentioning here work against all plugins which prevent copying content. This means you don&rsquo;t need to know which plugin is used by the website that is stopping you from copying, following solution simply work against anything.</p>

<h3>How do these plugins work?</h3>

<p>Although this is not necessary to stop those copy protector plugins, but having proper knowledge is a good thing.</p>

<p>What we see on a web page is HTML content which is styled with CSS stylesheets. HTML and CSS do not offer much programming power to do anything like stopping people from copying content.<br/>
But there is a third power on the webpage which is actually used for programming fancy things on a web page. Its called javascript.</p>

<p><strong>Javascript</strong> is a web scripting language that run in our browser, which can do many many awesome things. Preventing us from copying is one of them. So if we can somehow disable the execution of javascript in our browser, all those plugins which stop us from copying content will simply stop working.</p>

<h3>But how do we do it?</h3>

<p>In previous versions of most browsers, one setting was provided to switch off javascript. But not anymore. New browser no more provide this option since more and more websites are becoming javascript heavy and they simply do not work if javascript is disabled.<br/>
So we need a third party tool which can disable javascript in the browser.</p>

<h3>Browser plugins to the rescue</h3>

<p>Most browsers have addons or plugins which we can install in the browser. Various plugins are available to disable javascript in browsers. We can search the browser addon market and find many.</p>

<h4>Our favorite plugin for this purpose</h4>

<p><strong><a href="http://noscript.net/">No Script</a></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://doc-10-3s-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/ha0ro937gcuc7l7deffksulhg5h7mbp1/eon6j3j90nlhk062379b2ms23gemsbrr/1391011200000/04897958604571837647/*/0B2snz8-UNBEmQVdKd201Y1M4UTA?h=16653014193614665626" alt="Trick to copy content from a website with Copy Protector enabled" /></p>

<p>The NoScript Firefox extension provides extra protection for Firefox browsers. It is free and open source add-on which allows JavaScript, Java, Flash and other plugins to be executed only by trusted web sites of your choice. NoScript also provides the most powerful anti-XSS and anti-Clickjacking protection ever available in a browser. <br/>
With noscript we can choose which site can execute javascript and which can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><strong>So what we actually have to do?</strong></p>

<p>Just install noscript in firefox and follow the tutorial.</p>

<h2>Tutorial to copy content from a website with Copy Protector enabled</h2>

<p>Okay this is a really small tutorial here.<br/>
When you have noscript installed in firefox, there will appear an icon like this in your firefox window.</p>

<p>By default noscript do not allow any site to execute any javascript, java or flash code. So most sites will just stop working the way they usually do.</p>

<p>So first thing we have to do is disable the noscript gloablly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Click on the noscript icon and unselect &ldquo;Forbid Scripts globally&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>


<p>It will show a warning messag saying</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scripts are going to be allowed globally (for every site).
  This is a potentially dangerous action.
  Do you really want to proceed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just ignore it and press ok.</p>

<ul>
<li>Now open the site from which you want to copy content.</li>
<li>With that site&rsquo;s page open, again click on the no-script icon and select  &ldquo;Mark &lt;site-name> as Untrusted&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>Doing this will auto-refresh the page and no-scripts will be run from that page. This means none of the copy blocking plugins will work.</p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s what we wanted to achieve. If you have any questions and queries, please feel free to ask in comments. We also have forums where you can ask any question and me and our team will try to answer as per our knowledge.</p>

    <link href="http://harkuchh.com/corporate-society-is-fraud-bitch-please/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-05T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harkuchh.com/corporate-society-is-fraud-bitch-please</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[You might have heard about Corporate, The <b>Corporate Infocom Pvt. Ltd</b> or <b>Corporate Society</b>, and if you have heard <b>about</b> <b>Corporate Society</b> then there are two strong possibilities that you may heard it’s a great emerging <b>Indian networking company</b> originated from <b>capital of India</b>, Delhi or you may have heard that <b>Corporate society is fraud</b>, fake, cheater company who <b>make people especially youth fool by making fake promises</b> to them. I have no idea what exactly you have heard <b>about</b> <b>Corporate Infocom Pvt. Ltd</b> but I’m damn sure, whatever someone told you <b>about Corporate</b> will be something like that, well just give your sometime to this post and let me explain what is the truth behind Corporate Society.<!--more-->

&nbsp;

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/corporate-society-is-fraud-bitch-please/corporate-is-fraud-or-not/" rel="attachment wp-att-8601"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8601" alt="Corporate is Fraud or not" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Corporate-is-Fraud-or-not-580x213.jpg" width="580" height="213" /></a>

&nbsp;

I promise you whatever I’m going to tell you is absolutely truth and trusted because I also joined corporate and I know almost everything about it, I joined corporate and it changed my life completely, hold on ! don’t react too fast, first listen what I’m talking about, Yes this is true that my life got changed and corporate is responsible behind it.

Now I know, you wanted to know, How my life got changed because of Corporate Society ? it’s answer is, corporate gave me that platform on which I’m working right now and this platform have a glorious future ahead, it’s called Blogging. Actually before joining<strong> CIPL</strong> I had no Idea how to develop a complete website and run it on internet even after I was a engineering student from I.T trade, I knew how to create a webpage by using HTML and PHP but if we know how to create a webpage it doesn’t mean we can also make a website with that comfort for example creating a webpage by using HTML is like making a 5 second ad commercial and developing a website is something like making of Titanic and I don’t think I need to explain what is the difference between making these two.

In short, it was not possible for me to create even a 4-5 page static website and deploy it on Internet then you can easily think that how could I think of creating a website like Harkuchh, pay your attention, right now I’m just talking about creating a website not SEO, ranking, Backlinks, Ads, commercial emails, advertising, Social promotion, Database, My Sql, affiliate marketing  etc etc and etc but as you can see today I own a website with world rank near to 25k worldwide and around 2k in India and unbelievable fact is that the worth of my website is more than my dad’s property! and that all is live and true you know why ? because of corporate. Corporate told me I can do it, and I did.

Now let me tell you, if it’s true then why people says Corporate is fraud, fake, cheater and blaw&#8230; blaw&#8230; blaw :P

Well Corporate is actually a networking company, who sales it’s web hosting service by following a referral marketing strategy i.e Corporate gives web hosting for a website and chance to work in networking to it’s associates, and the real story begins here..

When a person is approached for a seminar or PPT (paper presentation) by a friend or any known, he/she’s told by the presenter that we’ll give you hosting to create your own website and tell you how to earn money through Google Adsense and other Ads and along with this, company will also give you some extra money as commission if someone join the company by your referral.

After joining, some finds it more profitable to work in network marketing so they start working in it,else who wanted to create their website start working on their website, but when any problem arises to them they expect help from the seniors but their seniors won’t help them (I’m always present to help you) this is a bitter but truth, and this is the biggest reason people call the <b>Corporate is fraud</b> <b>company</b>, but point to pay the attention again is that it’s just a hurdle and if seniors not helping someone and they stop working then it’s neither the senior’s nor company’s it’s your fault. Because problem arise to everyone it doesn’t mean you can not proceed after that, there are so many examples who did it all without the help of any seniors, I’m also one of them.

<span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>&#8220;</b></span><span style="color: #003366;"><em>If you need any kind of help in making website, increasing ranking, traffic, getting Adsense, earnings you can contact me any time, my contact details are given in Author Box in sidebar. If you want to create or develop a website only and not interested in Networking part then also you can contact me for the solution of your problem</em></span>.

<h2><span style="font-family: georgia;"><b>Reviews About Corporate Society
</b></span></h2>
Many people call it fraud, fake blaw&#8230;blaww&#8230; blaw&#8230;. and many people worship corporate, let me share some reviews from the person who are/were the part of Corporate Infocom Private Limited.

<b>Conclusion </b>: Corporate Society is not a fraud company, it’s all crap ! many people living their life happily on internet world because of Corporate Society, well yes it’s true that many people leaved and leaving corporate society and they doing their own business after leaving corporate but it’s also a fact that whatever they are today because of corporate Society, they are thinking they are king but they may forgot every king was once a child, in short if there would be <strong>no corporate Society</strong> then there would be no&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; , no&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; and even no&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;

    <link href="http://harkuchh.com/why-your-comments-not-getting-approved/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-29T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harkuchh.com/why-your-comments-not-getting-approved</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Comments are the basic, easiest and most popular way to <strong>create backlink from a good reputed blog</strong> to your blog, maybe you already know this, may be you don’t. If you know it, that’s good but if you don’t then you must need to know it, because in this awesome business called `<a title="What is Blogging, Why Blogging becoming Popular in Youth ?" href="http://harkuchh.com/what-is-blogging-why-blogging-becoming-popular-in-youth/" target="_blank"><strong>Blogging</strong></a>` links and <a title="read : What is Backlink and How to Build Back Links" href="harkuchh.com/what-are-the-back-links-and-how-to-build-back-links/" target="_blank"><strong>backlinks</strong></a> have a great importance.<!--more-->

Many people are facing a problem in commenting, this might be possible that you also having that problem, problem of not getting your comments approved. Don’t worry today your this problem will be solved, all you need to do is, just read this post very carefully.
<h2><strong>Reasons for Comments not Accepting</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Formality</strong></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>`Oh Wow&#8230;. What a nice post, great work.`</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>`This is a good post, thanks for sharing.`</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>`Full of information, nice thank you.`</strong></p>
These kind of comments are totally formality, if you post comments like that on others blog and hope that those will be approved, you are simply a newbie. Bloggers want real appreciation or suggestions to their work, they don’t need these kind of formality, see if they have written a post, they already know that it’s a great post, you don’t need to tell them it’s great.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>No Gravtar Image</strong></h3>
If you commented on a blog and your comment not got approved by webmaster, this point is may be responsible for it, if you have not setted up a Gravtar image for your profile, Bloggers always want their blog to look good and believe me a comment without Gravtar image looks ugly in comment section and most of the people hate it and they don’t accept comments, no matter how good they are. See : <a href="http://harkuchh.com/how-to-show-photo-with-comment-on-website/" target="_blank"><em>How to Show your photo with your comment</em></a>.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Fake Accounts</strong></h3>
Never ever use any fake account for commenting purpose, see if a blogger is capable to make you comment on his blog, it simply means he/she is a person with decent knowledge and they can easily find out if your details are fake and in that case there is no chance of approving of your comment, Be original comment with your name, your profile.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Comment not related to the Article</strong></h3>
If you are reading a post pertaining to blogging or SEO and if at the end of the post you are commenting about Justin Bieber, you are simply showing you have lack of knowledge and you are just trying to show your presence there, which doesn’t have any meaning, so don’t do that ever.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Comment for Link</strong></h3>
Everybody know if someone is commenting on a blog most probably he is doing that for one basic purpose, that is backlink but if you are showing this clearly through your comment that you only want a backlink from that blog, you don’t care about their content of post they will not approve your comment in any case. You need to understand their write ups and then generate question from it, then if you will ask a question from the blogger regarding the post, they will surely approve your comment and will reply back.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Link in Comment</strong></h3>
I’m really unable to understand how people are doing this foolishness even in these days. They open a post on a popular blog and writes.

<em>`This is really a good information check this out http:&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.’</em>

if you have done this it’s ok, everyone was a stupid once, but if you are going to do this again ever, you are going to waste your time, nobody like this type of comment strategy and only inexperienced bloggers approves these type of comments.

You can add link to your comment but only and only when it is must needed, generally never do this, this shows you are new, immature and unknown to blogging.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Wrong Language and Words</strong></h3>
Don’t use cheap language or any bad stuff related to any religion, racism, or any country. vulgarity is strictly prohibited in the business of blogging, if you are not happy with something that’s your problem don’t show your Pent up feelings to anyone, nobody cares, nobody likes it and this is true. Your comment will be trashed immediately.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Fallacious English</strong></h3>
This is also a big reason for not getting a comment approved, as big bloggers want their post and blog to look good they also like to see good things in comments below their post. Wrong language and broken English is like a blot to their awesome work and everybody hates it, like you do, so always try to be simple, original and straight forward.

Must read : <a href="http://harkuchh.com/tag/adsense/" target="_blank"><em>Best and All Adsense Tips and Tutorials.</em></a>

If you have read this post in the same way I said above, `carefully` then I promise your every comment will be approved at every blog, you just take care of these points and comment originally, related to the topic, in proper language strictly avoid formality and vulgarity. Before commenting must read the post and nothing will be more awesome than this, if your comment will have a doubt or query related to the topic written in post.

This is it, you have done, database of your website has been optimized, if you have any sub-domains or any Add on domains in your account then just do same things (step 3 to 5) to optimize their databases.

<strong>Database optimization</strong> is recommended to do on a regular basis as a preventive measure, it doesn’t take much effort but it do affect a site’s or blog’s performance a lot.

Google generally evaluates how many links there are to your blog from other pages, and the relevance and quality of the linking sites.
<h2><b>How to Get Google Pagerank </b></h2>
<b>Getting pagerank</b> or <b>improve page rank</b> is not everyone’s cup of tea.

<h3><b>High Quality Content</b></h3>
Well, in <a href="http://harkuchh.com/category/blogging/" target="_blank">blogging</a> field it is most important to know that `<b>Content is King</b>` if you want Page Rank for your blog or you want <b>increase Page Rank</b>, then you must have high quality original content on your blog. If your blog will have original and valuable content then readers will love to spend their time reading your articles and sharing goes higher this way.

<b> </b>
<h3><b>Guest posting</b></h3>
Guest posting is the most popular, trusted and <b>effective way to get PR for a blog </b>see when you writes a guest post for a blog having remarkable Page Rank, then you gets a high-quality, relevant inbound link to your website and Google gives it preference more than anything else to consider a blog for giving Pagerank.You must ensure that the blog where you’re going to publish your article is a reputed blog and it’s having good Page Rank.

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Directory Submission</b></h3>
Directory submission is a bit time consuming process, but it is also true that in order to boost Page Rank you must have high quality Backlinks associated with your blog name and believe me submit your site on different web directories and article directories  is the best way to generate quality backlinks for any blog. Some popular Directories to submit your blog link are Yahoo Directory, DMOZ, Best Of The Web, Ezine Articles, Article Base.

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Comment on Blogs</b></h3>
I think this is the easiest and most crucial step in getting and improving Google Page Rank. Blogging requires a Blogger very active socially. When you land on any blog for any kind of information make it your habit to leave a genuine comment there, because some Blogs are Do-Follow and they can help you to easily generate back links for your blog.

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Social Bookmarking</b></h3>
I don’t think I need to explain importance of Social Bookmarking, as it is a most common effective way to get free traffic as well as increase Page Rank, look when we share our Site on different Social networks we gets decent traffic and also free Backlink. Most popular Social Bookmarking Sites are Facebook, g+, Twitter, Stumble Upon , digg.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Website Accessibility</strong></h3>
This is the fact which most of the people don’t care about, but this plays very significant role in reputation of your blog in front of Google. It can be easily understood that, if a Website remains  down for a long period of time, Google slowly reduce the ranking of that particular site. So You must ensure that your Website is always up.

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Regularly Updation</b></h3>
Imagine you’re a teacher and there are many student in your class, some comes for lecture occasionally where as some comes daily, then whom will you prefer as your best students, you know your answer very well, same like that Google really like blogs that keep their content fresh and unique. The more you post, Google crawls your site more and it simply increases chances for you to improve page rank.

Fun Blogging : <a title="Google is male or female ?" href="http://harkuchh.com/google-is-a-girl-i-can-prove-it/" target="_blank"><em>Google is a Girl, I can Prove it</em></a>.

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Link Exchange</b></h3>
This technique is one of that rare technique which is in use from the starting of blogging and surprisingly it still works, many tops bloggers doing this and in order to get a good Page Rank for your blog, you should link your blog to high page rank blogs, by following this you will surely get  Page Rank for your blog and also your blog will get traffic from that site.

<b> </b>
<h3><b>No-follow Links</b></h3>
There are millions of blogger over internet world these days, and they keep on posting on their blogs and websites for some specific purposes but I bet most of them don’t know about dofollow and nofollow links properly and because of lack of knowledge about this, they are spreading free dofollow links to other sites unnecessarily. Must read : <i>How to make a link nofollow or dofollow</i>.

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Keywords and Tags</b></h3>
You may know that already, keywords and meta tags are one of the key factor for getting traffic to a site and it is one of the most crucial factors in the <b>search engine ranking</b> system. This step is quite taskful as searching of valuable keywords in never easy and once you get best keywords by following it&#8217;s searching and competition volume, use them strategically. This will boost your Traffic, ranking, earnings and yes Page Rank.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong></strong><b>Inter Linking </b></h3>
Inter linking your posts is a way to provide access to a related posts from one post and it’s a very useful tool to get better ranking, it increases your websites accessibility so when you think you can link your any previous post to your new one must integrate them because this is a basic as well as effective technique for <b>effective link building</b>.

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Engage Visitor</b></h3>
Nothing is more effective than this point, if you successfully keep your the visitors engaged in reading your Articles via interesting and likeable stuff. You can make your visitor stick to your blog by interactive site design, interesting feedback section and Videos which make the visitor watch them.

Also read : <a title="Make much of promoting, free !" href="http://harkuchh.com/idiotic-but-superb-tricks-to-promote-your-blog/" target="_blank"><em>Idiotic but superb ways to promote your blog</em></a>.

Google have not updated PR after it’s last updation in Feb, 2013 so it is expected that, next <b>PR distribution</b> date is very close now, so without wasting time start try to link your blog with <b>high</b><b> pr sites</b> and if you can successfully get <b>high pr back links </b>then <b>chances of getting PR</b> increases much more.

You can also go for <b>Website Advertising</b>, <b>participation on forums</b> for making your blog presence everywhere you can, but don’t ever use any <b>illegal or wrong way to getting backlink</b> to your blog because in starting they may give you some links and traffic but eventually it sounds so bitter and you may fall in trouble, so Be Genuine, Be original, Work your Ass off and leave rest on <strong>G(od+oogle)</strong> Happy Blogging, I really hope Google will give you and Me Page Rank in this update.. ;)

<span style="color: #333333;">The hardest part of getting started with Adsense is getting Google to approve your website.

The solution of such problem is to make your blog prepared before you apply for Adsense.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">You can’t start using Google Adsense on your Blog until you are approved by Google.

If your site doesn’t fall within the guidelines that Google sets out, it will be denied.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;"> Some very important points are listed below which every webmaster or Blogger need to keep in their mind and follow them carefully before applying for Google Adsense Account..</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Points need to focus for approved by Google Adsense :</strong></span></h3>

</ul>
<span style="color: #333333;"> Now you may understand Creating a website is not a big deal at all, the real challenge is to get traffic and that too from search engines so if your blog has very less traffic than wait few months and than apply for Adsense.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Your website should be according to the Terms and Conditions of Google make it sure there is  no adult content, warez, gambling sites, Hacking and hate spreading contents &amp; Copyrighted Data or post on your website.</span>

<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong> Quality and Original  Content
</strong></span></h3>

<hr />

<span style="color: #333333;">Quality Content is the Best than anything on a blog,  as a famous writer said “<em><strong>It’s Good to publish a single quality Article once in a week than Publishing Scrap Daily</strong></em>”. This is very simple to understand If Post or Content on your Blog is Original (not copyrighted) and written in the best manner then your Application will be accepted very easily by the Adsense Team.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;"> </span>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Simple and Easy Design</strong></span></h3>

<span style="color: #333333;"> Before submitting your site for Adsense make sure that the design you use in the site is a simple one with no much graphics works also it is nice if you have a easy navigation process in your site and try to avoid other ad networks while the reviewing process is going on, its not a compulsory one but a simple factor which may  help you to get the Adsense. </span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Also remember to avoid any kinds of adult, hate spreading and Hacking contents since Adsense won&#8217;t approve any sites that is having such contents.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;"> </span>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[In blogging many people says that I applied for Ads to the Google, but my application got rejected or whenever I apply for Adsense Ads, Google disapproves my request. Even my requests got disapproved two times before I got approved, but people don’t know, what are the reasons responsible for the disapproval of their Adsense application, Google always mentions some reasons in reply email which are responsible for not accepting one’s Ads application. If you read those email(s) properly then you will understand some of the points why Google rejected it.<!--more-->

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/most-common-reasons-for-disapproval-of-google-adsense-application/google-adsense-disappoval-reasons/" rel="attachment wp-att-8382"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8382" alt="Google Adsense Disappoval reasons" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Google-Adsense-Disappoval-reasons-580x229.jpg" width="580" height="229" /></a>
<h2><strong>Here are the some most common reasons for disapproval of your Adsense Application..</strong></h2>
<h1 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. Too Many Tags or Keywords</span></h1>
You  might know that Tags plays a very important role in improving your page&#8217;s visibility in the search engines. Search engines always search for the tags which show what is in your post. Actually these tags are the keywords or the word phrases that people types on different search engines for searching answer of their query. If you don’t know that then must settle this thing in your mind that, you should not give too many keywords in your post, because sometimes written articles are not so informative, but if it contains too many keywords search engines crawls, just because there are many keywords, but Google will not take the post as a healthy webpage, which makes a negative impression of your site to the search engine and Google never approve ads request from those blogs/sites.

Tags must be used in the post according to it’s quantity and quality. Using unusual, useless and irrelevant tags with an article reduces your credibility with the search engines and even people who come to see your website will not feel good, just imagine the moment you are searching for something and you open pages shown from search engine but you won’t find anything about the thing you are searching for, I’m sure you will never comeback to that particular site then why someone comes to your.

See using irrelevant, useless and inappropriate tags in your post may increase your visitors but Google will not accept your Adsense request, because as a good service provider Google always wants to provide best output to the every person using it.
<h1 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"> 2. Lack of Quality Content</span></h1>
You must read this very very carefully, whenever you start writing for you website or any website you must write informative and original content instead of copying someone’s idea before you apply for Google Adsense. As I said Google is the best search engine and as the best service provider Google always looks for content that visitors would love to read from beginning till the end. If your website contains very few articles you will find it really difficult to get approve Adsense account. Atleast in the beginning, prefer to write content that which attaract the attention of readers so that Google consider your application. In your post use titles  and heading that are catchy as well as popular, and never neglect to post genuine and innovative material.and one most important point in article writing is it is better to have text as well as quality pictures in your post and also include videos too, these things make the post more interactive. People love to stay on those pages instead of the webpages that contain only text in post, but it doesn’t mean you use use picture in each of your post, if pictures are not relevant don&#8217;t use them.
<h1 style="padding-left: 30px;"> <span style="color: #000000;">3. Presence of Copied Content</span></h1>
People think they can make Google fool but dear this is really a very tough thing to do, so if you are using any kind of copy paste either you stop this or stop dreaming of Adsense ads on your site because Google really hate copied and it’s not so tough for google to figure out copied content in a post or webpage, You may don’t know that but it’s true that by doing this you are harming your prestige in the cyber world. Google uses many algorithms and systems to track any kind copied content or any material easily, and most important by doing this you will disgrace your image in front of your readers.

It’s pretty easy to understand that, copy+paste is very easy for anyone one can copy content of a website and paste it on his own but as we know such kind of content isn’t consider as new and so that the particular blog or site will not get indexed by search engines and will not get ranking too. If Google or other search engines will not index your page then from where you will get visitors, from nowhere ! and as the result visits, views and clicks on your blog will be very low and you will get nothing. In short don’t do copy-paste.
<h1 style="padding-left: 30px;"> <span style="color: #000000;">4. Invalid Clicks and Comments</span></h1>
Many people generally thinks that if they click on their webpages their pageviews, traffic will increase and by doing this they will earn better but guys it’s called invalid clicks which is considered as a fraud or cheating by the internet companies. People who don’t have Adsense yet must remember, invalid clicks activity will make it much more difficult for your blog to get approved and even if you have approved Adsense account it doesn&#8217;t meant it will stay with you forever, invalid clicks and impression can also lead to cancellation of your approved adsense account.
<h1 style="padding-left: 30px;"> <span style="color: #000000;">5. Incomplete Websites</span></h1>
This is the most important factor people don’t think about, they won’t give their attention to this but Google does, various necessary pages like About page, Privacy page and Contact page is very essential for Adsense, these pages provides info. about the blogger and Blog (the content what your blog contains) it creates a bond between readers and the blogger. Before submitting your application for Google Adsense you must have complete webpages that can be considered by Google, and yes Incomplete webpages will not be accepted and your application will get rejected until you complete it and resubmit your form.

I hope my effort help you, for any query, suggestion must comment, don&#8217;t forget to share..

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[SEO (<strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong>) is the most critical factor which is responsible for optimizing of any<a href="http://harkuchh.com/category/blogging/" target="_blank"><strong> blog or website</strong></a> and make it&#8217;s appearance on all the <strong>top Search Engine</strong> in searched Results which enhance the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="read how to increase your site traffic" href="http://harkuchh.com/how-to-increase-website-blog-traffic-and-ranking/" target="_blank"><strong>traffic on your a website</strong></a></span>. Critical factor which is important here is to get the keywords on which you want the visitors to <strong>reach your site through SERP</strong> (Search Engine Results Page). Well in case you are new in blogging field then you must need to  be aware of some very <a href="http://harkuchh.com/tag/seo/" target="_blank"><strong>basic SEO tips and tricks</strong></a> to <strong>improve your website’s ranking</strong> in the Search engine results.<!--more-->

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Awesome-SEO-Tricks-to-Optimize-Your-Website-in-SERP.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8942" alt="Awesome SEO Tricks to Optimize Your Website in SERP" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Awesome-SEO-Tricks-to-Optimize-Your-Website-in-SERP.png" width="430" height="309" /></a>
<h2><strong>Awesome SEO tricks to Optimize Your Website in SERP</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Keywords in Title Tag</strong></h3>
<strong></strong> If you know about this then read this point one time and if you are not familiar with this I will recommend you to read this at least thrice, Title Tag is one of the most important factor to take  your posts on higher level searched results based on Keywords you chosen. This tag gets visible in the clickable link on the SERPs. It is always recommended to to start your title with a long-tail keyword having less competition, you must use <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://adwords.google.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Adwords too</strong></a><strong>l</strong></span> for this. Always try to use your Keyword within the range of 65 characters as search engine bots give preference to them, and always try to repetition of Keywords in your posts title otherwise your site could be penalized.
<h3><strong>Use Keywords in Header Tags</strong></h3>
Header tags are one of the most compelling on-page search engine optimization factors. Try to use the same keywords in all the heading tags by following this simple trick you can easily transfer focus of the page on a single keyword while superiority in search engines. You should better use your main keyword in the first section tag and try to keep the use of keywords in mandatory required way.
<h3><strong>Use Keywords in Image Alt tag</strong></h3>
I think this point is very much responsible for success of Harkuchh.com and many other blogs on web, Images are best way to express many words, and Search Engine Spiders don’t understand image so it have to translate any images they only read the alt tag with text description to understand the image. Therefore, it is essential to have a substantial description of any image you use in your post on your website. This will surely optimize the images in your content and rank higher in search image.
<h3><strong>Use Power of Internal Linking</strong></h3>
Never ever make mistake of avoiding internal linking as it’s one of the most significant factor and most of the bloggers specially Newbies often ignore Internal Linking which lead them to failure. The better approach is to reactivate and revitalize the old posts in archive, as compared to link them in your fresh posts. Never ignore the role of internal linking in the distribution of page rank.
<h3><strong>Links from Directories</strong></h3>
There are so many top Directories over internet which helps the submitted websites and links to get searched on search engines so Planting in directories, like Google’s Webmasters, Yahoo, DMOZ and some other article and content directories can be very helpful to achieve positive ranking and get more searched as well.
<h3><strong>Meta Description</strong></h3>
Well Google now gives quite less importance to meta tags but still there are two meta tags matter in SEO, Meta description tag are important for both human and search engine perspective. Description meta tag is what you use to illustrate your website. In fact, this description is what visitors see when your site appears in the search results.
<h3><strong>Use Keywords Meta Tag</strong></h3>
Put your relevant keywords in Keywords tags but take care of avoiding replicas and Keyword stuffing in post, tags or anywhere else. The keywords that you mention in the keyword tag is used to the context of your page are relevant, and the keywords used in meta keywords must be written somewhere in your post or article, if you will not do this by this way your website will be penalized for irrelevant content and it will give you that pain which is not easy to suffer from.

    <updated>2013-06-28T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harkuchh.com/how-to-make-a-link-nofollow-in-wordpress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Before proceeding, I think knowing the <strong>difference between a no-follow and a do-follow link</strong> is very vital, Nofollow and dofollow are two very oftenly used words in SEO. Blogging became very popular in last half decade, but many Bloggers of our generation making a big mistake in blogging, and it is spreading of dofollow links to other website-blogs unnecessarily<a href="http://Google.com/" target="_blank">.</a><!--more-->
<strong></strong>

See, while writing post on your blog when you give a link of any other blog somewhere in your post it becomes a dofollow link and by this way you are giving a free do follow link to that blog, which is really not needed<a href="http://bing.com/" target="_blank">.</a>

A normal <b>Dofollow</b> <b>link</b> allows all <a href="http://harkuchh.com/" target="_blank">search engines</a> to follow them and reach the linked website. It give link juice and a back link. If a webmaster is linking back to you with this link both Search Engine and people will be able to follow. Enable The best way to give someone dofollow love making keyword in the anchor text. This means that when you use a link to a website or page, the targeted keywords as anchor text.

A modified <b>Nofollow links</b> does not allow any search engine robot to surf the link, now here point to pay attention is that, if you’ll give a nofollow attribute tag to a links on your web page or website it links you from other page but because of nofollow attribute, it does not pass <a href="http://harkuchh.com/category/blogging/" target="_blank"><b>link juice</b></a>. Any Reader can only follow the links but search engines don’t.

It’s a strong Google’s recommendation that when we link our article with any other website we must have to be very sure that it’s a good website. Sometimes we need to link some p0rn , hacking kind of sites which are generally not consider as a legit or good site, there you will have to add nofollow link attribute. It becomes even more necessary if you are using affiliate marketing, and keep adding affiliate links on your blog.

Being truthful, adding a nofollow tag to any link is damn easy, in order to make any link nofollow, all you need to do is `<b>add nofollow attributes in HTML formal</b>` for example

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&lt;a href=&#8221;http://royalyouth.com&#8221; rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; &gt; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #008000;"><a href="http://Royalyouth.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #008000; text-decoration: underline;">Royalyouth</span></a></span></span>&lt;/a&gt;</strong></span>

But I’m pretty sure many of us wants to get things done more easier, I know some might not like the idea of using HTML to add Nofollow link attribute.
<h2>WordPress plugin to add no-follow Tag attribute</h2>
As the most awesome feature of WordPress is that, you can have plugin for doing almost any thing. For WordPress users there are some plugins which will let then make all the outgoing links nofollow, but we don’t have to make all external links nofollow because there are also several benefits of dofollow external link in SEO.

    <link href="http://harkuchh.com/things-to-ensure-before-applying-for-google-adsense/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-02T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harkuchh.com/things-to-ensure-before-applying-for-google-adsense</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span style="font-family: georgia;">I have written it many times and writing it again here that `Adsense is the King of all Ad Networks` and reasons are more than enough for this like  it’s payouts CPC (cost per click), CPM, CTR are much higher when compared to other Ads Networks, and off course due to the brand Google, almost every Blogger want Adsense on their Blog.<!--more--></span>

<span style="font-family: georgia;">Getting Adsense is not everyone’s cup of Tea, Google is very strict in order to approve Adsense account to any blog or website, there is no place for any mistake you need to follow their Terms and conditions very strictly, even a very small mistake can led to un-approval of your Adsense application.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia;">Here is the list of all important things you should ensure before applying for Adsense to Google.</span>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">1.          High Level Domain</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">When we apply for Adsense our site/blog undergoes two reviews, respectively called as Partial Review and Overall review. The first review can be easily surpassed if you have a domain ending  with .com, .org. In former time Adsense used to accept free domains from WordPress and blogspot but in present era Google become more choosy &amp; strict in its selection and give preference to high level domains ( .com, .org) in its first review.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">2.         Strictly Avoid <span style="color: #ff0000;">Copy+Paste</span></span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Before applying for Adsense must ensure that there is no copied content on your site or blog means you have not copied any post from any website and pasted on our site (most of people do this and later cry for Adsense). If you have any copied content on your website then `Google may surpass partial review but in second review your application will be disapproved for sure`, so if you are really serious about your earnings with Adsense do stick to the original content. If you don’t take it serious then you will get this reply from Google..</span>

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/things-to-ensure-before-applying-for-google-adsense/adsense-application-got-disapproved-because-of-copyrighted-material-pic/" rel="attachment wp-att-6300"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6300" alt="Adsense Application Got Disapproved because of Copyrighted Material Pic" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Adsense-Application-Got-Disapproved-because-of-Copyrighted-Material-Pic.jpg" width="463" height="220" /></a>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">3.         Enough content</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Insufficient no. of posts or so called less content also led to disapproval of an Adsense application. Some people will also tell you that `Content doesn’t play a bright role in Adsense approval` but sadly believe me it’s not true at all ! If you believe me, at least 10 posts should be  there before applying for Adsense otherwise be ready to receive this..</span>

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/things-to-ensure-before-applying-for-google-adsense/adsense-application-got-disapproved-because-of-insufficient-content-pic/" rel="attachment wp-att-6301"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6301" alt="Adsense Application Got Disapproved because of insufficient content Pic" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Adsense-Application-Got-Disapproved-because-of-insufficient-content-Pic.jpg" width="469" height="221" /></a>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">4.         Quality and Type of Content</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">In order to build a good relationship with Google Adsense, Content on your blog must obey rules stated by Google Adsense. Don’t promote any product related to Pornographic, Drugs, weapons or anything degrading nations &amp; religion peace. Google highly give preference to English as main language so you also try to provide content in form it wants. You may have noticed many sites have more than enough content but they have no Adsense, Do you know why ? because of quality and value of their content, and length of posts. A post should be at least of 300 words.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">5.         Age of Applicant</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Google wants to deal with Adults not teens i.e. Age plays an important role in Adsense Approval, if anybody is going to applying for Adsense then he/she must be 18 years old. If you are a blogger having blog fulfilling all the Terms and Conditions of Adsense but your age is less than minimum then you can apply for Adsense through email account of any member of family whose age  is 18+. Otherwise you will get this answer from Adsense..</span>

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/things-to-ensure-before-applying-for-google-adsense/adsense-application-got-disapproved-because-of-age-issue-pic/" rel="attachment wp-att-6299"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6299" alt="Adsense Application Got Disapproved because of age issue Pic" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Adsense-Application-Got-Disapproved-because-of-age-issue-Pic.jpg" width="433" height="110" /></a>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">6.         Easily visible About &amp; <a href="http://harkuchh.com/contact-us/" target="_blank">Contact Me</a> Page</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Many people won’t give their attention towards this but Google does, About page is very essential for Adsense, About page provides info. about the blogger and Blog (the content what your blog contain’s) it creates a bond between you and your readers. If you don’t have About Page on your blog then stop dreaming of Adsense ! Must mention your email address and your name same as that mentioned in the Adsense application this ensure trust that might build Adsense team on you.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia;">Along with About Page `Contact Me` Page is also required though which your readers directly interact with you, this will make your good image to Google. Adsense Team will be glad they are working with one, who not only care about Audience but also like to interact with them and Guide them. In short, this helps Google to make a conclusion that you are more interested in building Audience than earning money.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">7.         Blog design or Theme</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Always try to make your blog theme as simple as possible, because in creation of a building something big, every small things counted as important part.  Ensure that your blog is quick loading, SEO friendly, simple and easy for use of readers, in easy words let your blog describe what it is all about i.e and let a Gadget Blog looks like a Gadget.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">8.         Different Ad Networks</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Adsense allows different Ad networks along with it, but not every ! If you have no Adsense ads on your blog and you running Ads of other Networks and now you thinking of apply for Adsense  then I strongly recommend you to remove current ads or do check whether those ads are allowed with Adsense or not because even a minor mistake might count and become a negative point for your blog.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia;">I’m not saying that you stop permanently using other Ads on your blog, You just stop showing other network ads while applying for Adsense and let them off until Adsense team replies about your account acceptance. If Adsense approve your blog for Ads then you can check if those ads are allowed with Adsense or not then make decision of using them and if Adsense reject your application then you can continue with previous Ads.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">9.         Good Traffic</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">See, Google Adsense is the Ads King so they have millions of pending Ads request, Good Traffic is one of the main thing Adsense team always looks for, they focus at profit to their advertisers, Your dream of having Adsense Ads will be uncompleted until your blog get a good traffic at least 80-100 visitors per day, for more details you must check this post `<a href="http://harkuchh.com/time-to-apply-for-adsense/" target="_blank">What is the minimum requirement of Adsense</a>`.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">10.       Paid Traffic</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">People use some cheap ways to get traffic on their site one of the most common example is ‘Buying Traffic’, but Dear if you have a wish to earn from best Ads Company, you strictly avoid those cheap things because it might led to disapproval of your Adsense application, and yeah don’t think you are smart and you can make Google fool ! Instead there are many <a href="http://harkuchh.com/how-to-increase-website-blog-traffic-and-ranking/" target="_blank">ways to get massive traffic to your blog</a>.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">11.        Avoid Shortcuts, use Complete Words &amp; Sentences in Paragraphs</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">We have already discussed about `Quality and Type of Content` but I also wanted to tell my Readers that you must use proper completed sentences with formation of paragraphs after an interval interval, this is recommended by Adsense and avoiding it’s ‘Content Type’ criteria may led to disapproval of your Adsense application.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">12.        Privacy Policy</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">You must have <a href="http://harkuchh.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Privacy</a> policy on your blog, it gives a Professional touch to your blog. It can mention in any way, you can place this page with Titles ‘Privacy policy’ or ‘Terms and conditions’. Google says you must focus tio provide best service to your audience and all the readers and ignoring this may became a reason of disapproval of your Adsense Application, then why to take a chance.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia;">I have discussed all the important points and possible ways and it will help you to get an Approved Adsense for sure, now if you have any confusion, query, or point regarding it, please let me know via comment. It will be like an honor to interact with you.</span>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[To make decent money in Blogging the thing which every blogger needs more than anything else is <b>huge traffic to the blog</b>. We all are the bloggers and we know, every blogger, writer or webmaster wish to get more and <b>more traffic to their blog</b>, because it’s a simple formula i.e. <b>more audiences means more money</b>. I’ve seen many Bloggers doing very hard job on their blogs but still they won’t get the remarkable traffic to their blogs and I noticed generally they won’t pay their attention to <b>Back link building </b>and if you tell them to <b>generate backlinks</b> they thinks that we are asking them to <b>buy back links </b>because<b> </b>they don’t know the proper way to <b>building back links</b>, if you are one of them then must read this post at least twice because if you get it properly it will be the the best <b>SEO help </b>for you, forever<a href="http://bing.com" target="_blank">.</a><a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank">.</a><!--more-->
<h1><b>What are Back links ?</b></h1>
<strong>Backlinks</strong> enable the reader to keep track of some other pages on the web which is linked to the current post they are reading, let’s make it easy with an example, suppose I’ve written a post about <a href="http://harkuchh.com/tag/adsense/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Google Adsense</strong></span></a> on my blog and then you come to my blog and read that post, you finds it interesting, then you goes to your own blog and writes a post inspired by my post and you link your post with my original post from where you took the idea (remember giving credit is necessary). Now my post will automatically show that you has linked to it, and it will provide a short snippet of my text and a link to my post, that is the reason why in <b>seo backlink</b> plays a very important role.

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/What-are-the-Back-links-and-How-to-Build-Back-Links.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8894" alt="What are the Back links and How to Build Back Links" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/What-are-the-Back-links-and-How-to-Build-Back-Links.png" width="350" height="263" /></a>
<h2><b>Why Backlink is important ?</b></h2>
<b> </b>Backlink is one of the key factor to get good raputation to your blog as well as <b>buildings backlinks</b> are one of the best, popular and effective ways to <b>get more traffic to any blog or website </b>not only that it is also said that it is the best <b>search engine optimization strategy</b> generating backlinks..

&nbsp;
<h2><b>How to Build Backlinks ?</b></h2>
Well when it comes to building back links there are two <b>ways to generate backlinks for blogs</b> which are the <b>right way to build backlinks</b> and a <b>wrong way to build back links</b>, as it’s very valuable it take efforts but once you&#8217;ve done the right way, soon you will see the traffic coming to your blog.

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Let’s know what are the way to generate backlinks ?</b></h2>
<b> </b>
<h3>The Wrong Way to Build Backlinks</h3>
I know this very well because I also did it when I was new to this field but thankful to the <a href="http://Labnol.org" target="_blank"><strong>Labnol.org</strong></a> I came to know about it very soon and I stopped doing that, but what’s that ? Actually many people especially newbies normally tries to build their back links by the wrong way at one point due to lack of knowledge about it, people generally do not care that the way the are following is a wrong way, even if they knew. The wrong way to create backlink is, go and post your links every where you can, like in comments, social sites, but this is called spamming, by doing this you’re doing nothing more than posting irrelevant links and remember by following this way you will never get <b>quality backlinks</b>, for example you go to YouTube and open one of the Eninem’s video then in comments you post a comment with URL of your post `How to keep keep your Adsense Account Secure` boy by doing this you’re wasting your time because nobody is going click on that link and eventually your link will be removed.

&nbsp;
<h3><b>The Right Way to Build Quality Backlinks</b></h3>
Now you know what mistakes you were doing let’s know the <b>best way to build Quality backlinks</b>, well the right way to do it is Place your links to the relevant places where it would be useful, meaningful and desirable. if you’ll place your links to such pages then it will surely drive traffic to your blog easily. For instance you have written a post `<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://harkuchh.com/justin-biebers-untold-story/" target="_blank"><b>You are small enough to make fun of Justin Bieber</b></a></span>`then you go to some other websites with questions or controversy on Justin Bieber then you leave a relevant relevant comment with the link of your article where you have written something related to the topic like `No, you are wrong, you are making fun of Justin Bieber you’re calling him Gay but you don’t know his power <a href="http://harkuchh.com/justin-biebers-untold-story/" target="_blank">check this out</a> first and then see where you stands`.

&nbsp;

That way when readers will see your that strong &amp; meaningful comment related to the subject they are talking about will surely click on your link to see more information. Believe me this is the <b>best way to build smart referral link</b>. This is great quality of work which is important and when someone comes to that post and really find what they are looking for then most probably you will a potential fan and another reader.

&nbsp;

<b>Note</b> : If you will do it gently then you will never feel requirement of <b>search engine optimization packages</b>, <b>link building service</b><b> </b>for seo of your blog and that is the reason building quality backlinks is called as the <b>best search engine optimization </b>tool and it will let you save the expense of <b>search engine optimization software</b>s because the right way will give you <b>free back links</b>. This is the <b>affordable search engine optimization </b>strategy for everyone, after all it’s free.

Happy Blogging &#8230; :)

    <id>http://harkuchh.com/how-to-track-ip-who-performing-invalid-clicks-on-adsense-using-statcounter</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Just 2-3 days back I wrote a guest post for Ammar Ali’s  blog Allbloggingtips with title `<a title="checkout the Post" href="http://allbloggingtips.com/2013/04/16/protect-adsense-from-invalid-clicks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Why and How To Protect Adsense Account From Invalid Clicks?</em></a>` and because I wrote that post so Ammar sir gave me privilege to handle all the comments below that post, when I visited that page next day I saw many comments at the bottom, most of them thanked Author(<em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Haarkuchh" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">me</a></em>) for sharing that useful info but there I noticed almost every person saying <span style="font-size: medium;">`</span><em>Hey Thanks K.K this is really helpful, I&#8217;m also having a serious issue of invalid clicks on one of my websites these days you have given awesome info. kindly also tell us<strong> how to detect those IP’s from where invalid clicks are being performed on our blog<span style="font-size: large;">`</span></strong></em>, so this post is dedicated to all those bloggers who are keen to know `<strong>How to track invalid Adsense clicks</strong> using StatCounter`<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">.</a><!--more-->

Every Adsense publisher knows that <strong>Invalid Click Activity</strong> <strong>on Adsense Ads</strong> is really a very serious issue which can lead them to a banned Adsense account from Google and painful thing is that that ban remains permanent. Google may knows everything and it can give you result of any query but still it doesn’t provide any tool to <strong>detect the IP’s from where Invalid Clicks or Click Bombing have done</strong>. So it’s all publisher’s duty to fetch those IP’s to <strong>protecting their <a href="http://harkuchh.com/tag/adsense/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AdSense account</a> from Invalid Click Activity</strong>.

Many webmasters and bloggers have <strong>lost their AdSense account just because of Invalid Click Activity</strong> and their unawareness, but I’m sure you’re aware enough that’s why you are reading this article on <a href="http://harkuchh.com" target="_blank"><em>Harkuchh.com</em></a>, so let’s discus how to <strong>track the IP address from where you are getting Invalid Clicks on your Ads</strong>.

You can<strong> track every single</strong> <b>IP performing clicks on Adsense Ads</b> <strong>by using StatCounter</strong>, and it’s pretty easy. All you need to do is read and follow the given steps very carefully, must note that<span style="color: #ff0000;"> You can’t afford to miss any point</span>. Let’s start..
<h1><strong>Track invalid Adsense Clicks using Statcounter</strong></h1>
<strong>1.</strong> Create an account on <a href="http://statcounter.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Statcounter</a> by using your permanent email account.

<strong>2.</strong> After that you’ll need to create a new project for your website which you want to track. Click on <b>Add</b><b> New Project </b>and in Project url fill your website URL and fill all the required information like, Project Title, Country, Time Zone, etc. Just select <b>Invisible</b><b> Tracking</b> and you can choose to receive monthly or weekly reports via email<a href="http://yahoo.com/" target="_blank">.</a>

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/How-To-detect-IP-Performing-invalid-Clicks-on-Adsense-Ads-tutorial.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8760" alt="How To detect IP Performing invalid Clicks on Adsense Ads tutorial" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/How-To-detect-IP-Performing-invalid-Clicks-on-Adsense-Ads-tutorial.jpg" width="554" height="292" /></a>

&nbsp;

<strong>3.</strong> Once you’re done with the previous step, StatCounter will <strong>detect the platform of your website</strong> and <strong>gives you a code</strong> with detailed instructions on <b>how to install the stat counter code in your website</b>, just follow the given instruction carefully<a href="http://bing.com" target="_blank">.</a>
<h1><strong>How to Track IP clicking on Ads</strong></h1>
Now once you have set statcounter for your website by following the given instructions, you can start viewing all your site related reports within minutes. Now back to the Statcounter Home page.

<strong>4.</strong> First of all click on your project name (your site) then click on <b>Stats </b>and next then click on <a href="http://harkuchh.com/how-to-track-ip-who-performing-invalid-clicks-on-adsense-using-statcounter"><strong>Exit Link Activity</strong></a> here you can find all the Links on which your visitors clicked to Exit from your site. You can find date, time, exit link name and also the page on which the exit link was clicked. <i>Exit link means the link by clicking which a user jumps to a new page that might be your Ad </i>or a link to any other website.

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/How-To-detect-IP-Performing-invalid-Clicks-on-Adsense-Ads.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8761" alt="How To detect IP Performing invalid Clicks on Adsense Ads" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/How-To-detect-IP-Performing-invalid-Clicks-on-Adsense-Ads.jpg" width="533" height="296" /></a>

If you will examine the links clicked<strong> you can find how many clicks are performed there on advertisements and also at what time the click was made</strong>.

So there you get all the clicks performed on your Ads but this information is not enough because still you are far from those IP’s from where clicks are done so let’s move further, look at the opened page you can easily see a <strong>Magnifying glass icon</strong> before the date in every row of the table. By clicking on that magnifying glass you will get to the page where you can see more detailed information about the visitor who clicked on the link.

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/How-To-Track-IP-who-Performing-invalid-Clicks-on-Adsense-using-StatCounter.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8762" alt="How To Track IP who Performing invalid Clicks on Adsense using StatCounter" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/How-To-Track-IP-who-Performing-invalid-Clicks-on-Adsense-using-StatCounter-580x138.jpg" width="580" height="138" /></a>

<strong>You can find the IP address of the clicker(s) here</strong> along with his location, host name, browser, OS, resolution, ISP, visiting length, and the pages he viewed including the exit link.

Now if you use a bit of your awesome brain you can track all the valid as well as invalid clicks on your Adsense Ads. If you find any IP clicked on your Ads many times it simply means you are <strong>being <a href="http://harkuchh.com" target="_blank">click bombed</a> by that IP</strong>, then you can disable ads temporarily on your website or remove your website from authorized websites list in Google AdSense, you can also ban the fetched IP for showing your Ads from cPanel of your site.

Hey publisher, it is highly recommended that whenever you feel any sudden or suspicious change in your Adsense Account  like <strong>sudden increase in Page CTR</strong> or many clicks but <strong>Zero or very low CPC</strong> then your most important task is to detect the location and IP address of the person doing invalid click activity on your Ads.

This is highly recommended because in case you unfortunately get <b>banned from AdSense because of invalid activity on Ads, </b><strong>you will have stats which you can use at the time of appeal for your account being reinstated</strong><b>.</b>

I hope if your question was <strong>how to check someone’s IP</strong> or how to find those IPs who are doing froud clicks, this <b>complete tutorial to featch the IP of invalid clicker on Ads</b> will help you to keep your Adsense safe and along with your forever, have a look of my other Adsense tutorials those will be also helpful for you. For this awesome guidance I expect a share and a comment from your side, will I get it..

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span style="color: #333333;">Few days back I created a Subdomain of my website and when I advertised it on Facebook one of my friend asked me Hey K.K, How did you created Subdomain of your website then I said to him that it’s very easy, you can we can create sub-domain of your website through cPanel.<!--more--></span>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>What is Subdomain ?</strong></span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">Subdomains are the third level domains that are used to organize different types of your web site content. Suppose you have a website on Automobile and now you also want to create a site for Gadgets at that time rather than purchasing a new domain, you can create sub domain using the domain you already own, and by this way you can create multiple site by purchasing only one domain.</span>

    <updated>2013-03-27T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harkuchh.com/how-to-get-started-with-linux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span style="font-family: georgia;">So are you eventually tired of Windows’ crashes and viruses ? I know many who are. It&#8217;s simply not worth to keep using a system which can&#8217;t even function properly (Windows you hearing me ?).<!--more--></span>

<span style="font-family: georgia;">I know you have heard of that Linux thing but never tried. Yes the rumors are true,Linux never crashes, and it never hangs. You don&#8217;t even need to press the refresh again and again to keep it working properly. It&#8217;s awesomeness in its most raw form.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia;">If you are reading this post you are most likely willing to get out of the jail Microsoft has put you in (and they even ask you to pay for it), or you are standing on the line to make the decision to give Linux a shot. If it&#8217;s the latter case, here are some features of Linux which should give you the final push.</span>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">Stable to its core</span></strong></span></h3>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">As I stated earlier, it&#8217;s a solid system. So solid that sometimes I am forced to wonder that even Ambuja Cement is no match for it. You can leave a computer running for a month in a cyber cafe, and even after the month it will be working as fast as ever, without any need of restart or anything at all. Hell, <strong>most servers run Linux</strong> (that include Google, Yahoo, Facebook and more) and they run literally for years non stop. Try that with your Windows machine ^_^</span>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">No viruses ever (god promise)</span></strong></span></h3>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">I can bet on this. Being a power user (and a proud geek) for about three years, I never ever faced a virus in Linux (never even heard of any). This is one thing you gonna miss the most once you start using (or enjoying I would say) Linux. How come Linux has no viruses? Read our previous post on <em><a href="http://harkuchh.com/why-virus-dont-work-on-linux/">Why virus don&#8217;t work on Linux</a></em>.</span>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">No Licenses</span></strong></span></h3>
Don&#8217;t want to pay for your &#8220;WINDOWS&#8221; anymore? You don&#8217;t need to. Linux is all free. You don&#8217;t need to pay a single paisa for it, and nobody will ask you to do that. You no more need to live in the fear that if you mistakenly update your windows someday, Microsoft will block your computer.
<span style="font-family: georgia;">No money? No worries, Linux is all free and open source (if you care about that).</span>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">Free Free Free</span></strong></span></h3>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Almost every software on Linux is free too. Literally each and everyone of these and millions of more.</span>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/#/Home" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Free Office suite </span></a></li>
	<li dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Free Photoshop, <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> we call it</span></li>
	<li dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.blender.org/"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Free Animation Studio</span></a></li>
	<li dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.mixxx.org/"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Free DJ Studio </span></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Linux is hard to use ?</span></h2>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">I heard someone saying that Linux is very hard to use. May be it was in 90&#8217;s. But. Wake up Sid, <a href="http://mediacdn.snorgcontent.com/media/catalog/product/g/e/geekisthenew_fullpic_1.jpg">Geek is the new sexy anyway</a>. Although you don&#8217;t need to be a <a href="http://channikhabra.blogspot.in/">geek</a> to use Linux, it&#8217;s too sexy man. Remember what Steve Jobs said? You need to think different. Very well then, Follow my lead.</span>
<h1 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">First steps in animal territory</span></h1>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">Taste Linux <span style="font-family: georgia;">without loosing Windows safe-house (pun intended)</span></span></h3>
Yup! You can install Linux like a windows program and then if you don&#8217;t like it just uninstall it like anything else.
It will still be the full blown Linux Operating System, but it will not affect your Windows. No, I am not talking about Virtual Box or VMware. What we are going to do is use a software which will install the Ububtu (most popular Linux) like any windows application.
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">Here&#8217;s how to do the magic</span></strong></span></h3>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">It&#8217;s basically the Ubuntu (very famous Linux distribution) which is installed with a program (WUBI) provided by Canonical (people that make Ubuntu)</span>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Download the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?release=latest&amp;bits=32&amp;distro=desktop&amp;status=zeroc">latest Ubuntu iso file</a></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Download latest <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?release=latest&amp;bits=32&amp;distro=wubi&amp;status=zeroc">Ubuntu Windows Installer</a> (wubi we call it)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Place the .iso file and wubi.exe in same folder and run wubi.exe</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Then Choose the drive you want to install Ubuntu in</span></li>
</ul>

<h1 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">Using Linux</span></h1>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">So now we can run Linux easily and play with it like a toy. But what next? Ubuntu has a very straight forward approach, nice looks and slick interface. There is no need of much illustration. Feel free to enjoy it to your heart&#8217;s content. Here are some tips and tricks about some new things you gonna find in Ubuntu.</span>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">Installing new software</span></strong></span></h3>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Installing new software in Linux is different from Windows. There are no .exe files or other setups like that which you can use to install software. Yea, that means you no longer need to click those next-next buttons for every software you want to install. Instead there is a software center where you can search for software, read the description about what the software do and install it if you want. The latest version of the software will then get downloaded and installed on your new machine. It&#8217;s more like an app store, and much powerful system then Windows&#8217; &#8216;setup&#8217; approach. We&#8217;ll discuss in some other post what&#8217;s so amazing about Linux approach of installing software.</span>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">Removing software</span></strong></span></h3>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">You guessed it right, the software center. It&#8217;s your one stop shop for every new software you want to install or remove.</span>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="font-family: georgia; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">What if you are offline ?</span></h3>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">That&#8217;s actually worst than it sounds. There are many <a href="http://channikhabra.blogspot.in/2011/07/why-not-to-install-linux-offline-and.html">problems you&#8217;ll face using Linux offline</a>. If you are using a computer which can&#8217;t stay online, I recommend not trying Linux on this machine. That is if you are new to Linux world. There are of course solutions to those problems (follow same link given above), but they are kind of hard for Linux beginners.</span>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">Watching videos and listening music</span></h3>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">You will not be able to listen to music or watch videos on Ubuntu you just installed, lol. Actually you can, but you need to download extra software for that. Why is it like this? Well, it&#8217;s because the decoder packages which are used to play music (mp3) and videos are not open source. In order to keep itself completely open and free, Ubuntu do not offer those software in default CD. You need to install them later.</span>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">How to do that ?</span></h3>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Simply try to play a mp3 and/or a video and Ubuntu will ask you to download and install some plugins. Click &#8216;Install&#8217; and get going. It will download about 28-35MB, and here you have the safest machine you can get with little to no effort on your part.</span>
<h1 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">Why should you use Linux ?</span></h1>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">If the reasons I gave in beginning of this article were not enough, here are some use cases that may convince you.</span>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">To Surf Internet</span></strong></span></h3>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Which is the safest way to surf the web? There is none. But you can minimize the risk by using Linux. Most bad websites assume you to be using Windows and try to hack using scripts which think exploit several &#8216;features&#8217;(?) of windows. Using Linux means automatic safety from 70% of those bad websites.</span>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">Lack of Anti-virus</span></strong></span></h3>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Are you tired of your antivirus screaming in your face to buy the pro version or singing the songs that its trial version is expired? No virus means no need for anti-virus. Use Linux, the &#8216;Ram-baan&#8217; for all viruses.</span>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">Transfer data from pen drives</span></strong></span></h3>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">If you are like me (and most people I know), there will be lots of times when you will need to use a pen drive (or data card) but you are scared that the pen drive would have virus. Just boot into Ubuntu and use it for all data transfer. Virus don&#8217;t spread by itself, it spread only when you open a virus file (which happens automatically when you open a pen drive). Using Linux can save your ass every time you need to use a pen drive.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia;">It is not that hard to use Linux as people say. Use this guide to help you, or you can contact me if you have any problem. I will be more than happy to help. Linux is the awesomeness you must not ignore. Even if you need to suffer a little with your first steps towards Linux, it&#8217;s worth the fruit you gonna get in the end.
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Happy hacking :)
