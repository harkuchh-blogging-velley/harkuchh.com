<div class="entry-content">You might have heard about Corporate, The <b>Corporate Infocom Pvt. Ltd</b> or <b>Corporate Society</b>, and if you have heard <b>about</b> <b>Corporate Society</b> then there are two strong possibilities that you may heard it’s a great emerging <b>Indian networking company</b> originated from <b>capital of India</b>, Delhi or you may have heard that <b>Corporate society is fraud</b>, fake, cheater company who <b>make people especially youth fool by making fake promises</b> to them. I have no idea what exactly you have heard <b>about</b> <b>Corporate Infocom Pvt. Ltd</b> but I’m damn sure, whatever someone told you <b>about Corporate</b> will be something like that, well just give your sometime to this post and let me explain what is the truth behind Corporate Society.<!--more-->
<br><br>

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/corporate-society-is-fraud-bitch-please/corporate-is-fraud-or-not/" rel="attachment wp-att-8601"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8601" alt="Corporate is Fraud or not" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/t1/1622048_620819387984253_705217368_n.jpg" width="580" height="213" /></a>
<br><br>

I promise you whatever I’m going to tell you is absolutely truth and trusted because I also joined corporate and I know almost everything about it, I joined corporate and it changed my life completely, hold on ! don’t react too fast, first listen what I’m talking about, Yes this is true that my life got changed and corporate is responsible behind it.
<br><br>
Now I know, you wanted to know, How my life got changed because of Corporate Society ? it’s answer is, corporate gave me that platform on which I’m working right now and this platform have a glorious future ahead, it’s called Blogging. Actually before joining<strong> CIPL</strong> I had no Idea how to develop a complete website and run it on internet even after I was a engineering student from I.T trade, I knew how to create a webpage by using HTML and PHP but if we know how to create a webpage it doesn’t mean we can also make a website with that comfort for example creating a webpage by using HTML is like making a 5 second ad commercial and developing a website is something like making of Titanic and I don’t think I need to explain what is the difference between making these two.
<br><br>
In short, it was not possible for me to create even a 4-5 page static website and deploy it on Internet then you can easily think that how could I think of creating a website like Harkuchh, pay your attention, right now I’m just talking about creating a website not SEO, ranking, Backlinks, Ads, commercial emails, advertising, Social promotion, Database, My Sql, affiliate marketing  etc etc and etc but as you can see today I own a website with world rank near to 25k worldwide and around 2k in India and unbelievable fact is that the worth of my website is more than my dad’s property! and that all is live and true you know why ? because of corporate. Corporate told me I can do it, and I did.
<br><br>
Now let me tell you, if it’s true then why people says Corporate is fraud, fake, cheater and blaw&#8230; blaw&#8230; blaw :P
<br><br>
Well Corporate is actually a networking company, who sales it’s web hosting service by following a referral marketing strategy i.e Corporate gives web hosting for a website and chance to work in networking to it’s associates, and the real story begins here..
<br><br>
When a person is approached for a seminar or PPT (paper presentation) by a friend or any known, he/she’s told by the presenter that we’ll give you hosting to create your own website and tell you how to earn money through Google Adsense and other Ads and along with this, company will also give you some extra money as commission if someone join the company by your referral.<br><br>
After joining, some finds it more profitable to work in network marketing so they start working in it,else who wanted to create their website start working on their website, but when any problem arises to them they expect help from the seniors but their seniors won’t help them (I’m always present to help you) this is a bitter but truth, and this is the biggest reason people call the <b>Corporate is fraud</b> <b>company</b>, but point to pay the attention again is that it’s just a hurdle and if seniors not helping someone and they stop working then it’s neither the senior’s nor company’s it’s your fault. Because problem arise to everyone it doesn’t mean you can not proceed after that, there are so many examples who did it all without the help of any seniors, I’m also one of them.
<br><br>

If you want to create or develop a website only and not interested in Networking part then also you can contact me for the solution of your problem</em></span>.

</b></span></h2>
Many people call it fraud, fake blaw&#8230;blaww&#8230; blaw&#8230;. and many people worship corporate, let me share some reviews from the person who are/were the part of Corporate Infocom Private Limited.

<td>If your senior/upline is Good to you then CIPL is good for you, If not then you will be frustrated after some time and say it is fraud. But actually it is not. People working is CIPL make it fraud by not supporting their downline. Chandan Sanwal</td>

&nbsp;</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Failure will never blame himself for his failure , he will always blame the platform he opted..but from my according every platform is best , its just how you perform out there..by this reason people who blame the platform to be as FRAUD and having belief that somewhere it was the platform only which was responsible for their failure , i personally call those people A BIG FRAUD for being FRAUD to themselves and to those whom they are saying the platform they opted was FRAUD&#8230;in the end THANX Corporate Society for providing me those things which are priceless to me..love u always..</td>

<td>It is the duty of the upline to train their downline, this lack of training is the main reason why some people become negative. But there are also some people who expect a lot to earn but never atleast try to work. Such people are also one of the reason for such rumors.
But it is a proved fact that corporate has changed the lifestyle of many people..</td>

<strong>Conclusion </strong>: Corporate Society is not a fraud company, it’s all crap ! many people living their life happily on internet world because of Corporate Society, well yes it’s true that many people leaved and leaving corporate society and they doing their own business after leaving corporate but it’s also a fact that whatever they are today because of corporate Society, they are thinking they are king but they may forgot every king was once a child, in short if there would be <strong>no corporate Society</strong> then there would be no&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; , no&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; and even no&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;
