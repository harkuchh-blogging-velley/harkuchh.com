<div class="entry-content"><span style="font-family: georgia;">I have written it many times and writing it again here that `Adsense is the King of all Ad Networks` and reasons are more than enough for this like  it’s payouts CPC (cost per click), CPM, CTR are much higher when compared to other Ads Networks, and off course due to the brand Google, almost every Blogger want Adsense on their Blog.<!--more--></span>

<span style="font-family: georgia;">Getting Adsense is not everyone’s cup of Tea, Google is very strict in order to approve Adsense account to any blog or website, there is no place for any mistake you need to follow their Terms and conditions very strictly, even a very small mistake can led to un-approval of your Adsense application.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia;">Here is the list of all important things you should ensure before applying for Adsense to Google.</span>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">1.          High Level Domain</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">When we apply for Adsense our site/blog undergoes two reviews, respectively called as Partial Review and Overall review. The first review can be easily surpassed if you have a domain ending  with .com, .org. In former time Adsense used to accept free domains from WordPress and blogspot but in present era Google become more choosy &amp; strict in its selection and give preference to high level domains ( .com, .org) in its first review.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">2.         Strictly Avoid <span style="color: #ff0000;">Copy+Paste</span></span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Before applying for Adsense must ensure that there is no copied content on your site or blog means you have not copied any post from any website and pasted on our site (most of people do this and later cry for Adsense). If you have any copied content on your website then `Google may surpass partial review but in second review your application will be disapproved for sure`, so if you are really serious about your earnings with Adsense do stick to the original content. If you don’t take it serious then you will get this reply from Google..</span>

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/things-to-ensure-before-applying-for-google-adsense/adsense-application-got-disapproved-because-of-copyrighted-material-pic/" rel="attachment wp-att-6300"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6300" alt="Adsense Application Got Disapproved because of Copyrighted Material Pic" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Adsense-Application-Got-Disapproved-because-of-Copyrighted-Material-Pic.jpg" width="463" height="220" /></a>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">3.         Enough content</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Insufficient no. of posts or so called less content also led to disapproval of an Adsense application. Some people will also tell you that `Content doesn’t play a bright role in Adsense approval` but sadly believe me it’s not true at all ! If you believe me, at least 10 posts should be  there before applying for Adsense otherwise be ready to receive this..</span>

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/things-to-ensure-before-applying-for-google-adsense/adsense-application-got-disapproved-because-of-insufficient-content-pic/" rel="attachment wp-att-6301"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6301" alt="Adsense Application Got Disapproved because of insufficient content Pic" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Adsense-Application-Got-Disapproved-because-of-insufficient-content-Pic.jpg" width="469" height="221" /></a>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">4.         Quality and Type of Content</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">In order to build a good relationship with Google Adsense, Content on your blog must obey rules stated by Google Adsense. Don’t promote any product related to Pornographic, Drugs, weapons or anything degrading nations &amp; religion peace. Google highly give preference to English as main language so you also try to provide content in form it wants. You may have noticed many sites have more than enough content but they have no Adsense, Do you know why ? because of quality and value of their content, and length of posts. A post should be at least of 300 words.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">5.         Age of Applicant</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Google wants to deal with Adults not teens i.e. Age plays an important role in Adsense Approval, if anybody is going to applying for Adsense then he/she must be 18 years old. If you are a blogger having blog fulfilling all the Terms and Conditions of Adsense but your age is less than minimum then you can apply for Adsense through email account of any member of family whose age  is 18+. Otherwise you will get this answer from Adsense..</span>

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/things-to-ensure-before-applying-for-google-adsense/adsense-application-got-disapproved-because-of-age-issue-pic/" rel="attachment wp-att-6299"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6299" alt="Adsense Application Got Disapproved because of age issue Pic" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Adsense-Application-Got-Disapproved-because-of-age-issue-Pic.jpg" width="433" height="110" /></a>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">6.         Easily visible About &amp; <a href="http://harkuchh.com/contact-us/" target="_blank">Contact Me</a> Page</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Many people won’t give their attention towards this but Google does, About page is very essential for Adsense, About page provides info. about the blogger and Blog (the content what your blog contain’s) it creates a bond between you and your readers. If you don’t have About Page on your blog then stop dreaming of Adsense ! Must mention your email address and your name same as that mentioned in the Adsense application this ensure trust that might build Adsense team on you.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia;">Along with About Page `Contact Me` Page is also required though which your readers directly interact with you, this will make your good image to Google. Adsense Team will be glad they are working with one, who not only care about Audience but also like to interact with them and Guide them. In short, this helps Google to make a conclusion that you are more interested in building Audience than earning money.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">7.         Blog design or Theme</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Always try to make your blog theme as simple as possible, because in creation of a building something big, every small things counted as important part.  Ensure that your blog is quick loading, SEO friendly, simple and easy for use of readers, in easy words let your blog describe what it is all about i.e and let a Gadget Blog looks like a Gadget.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">8.         Different Ad Networks</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">Adsense allows different Ad networks along with it, but not every ! If you have no Adsense ads on your blog and you running Ads of other Networks and now you thinking of apply for Adsense  then I strongly recommend you to remove current ads or do check whether those ads are allowed with Adsense or not because even a minor mistake might count and become a negative point for your blog.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia;">I’m not saying that you stop permanently using other Ads on your blog, You just stop showing other network ads while applying for Adsense and let them off until Adsense team replies about your account acceptance. If Adsense approve your blog for Ads then you can check if those ads are allowed with Adsense or not then make decision of using them and if Adsense reject your application then you can continue with previous Ads.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">9.         Good Traffic</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">See, Google Adsense is the Ads King so they have millions of pending Ads request, Good Traffic is one of the main thing Adsense team always looks for, they focus at profit to their advertisers, Your dream of having Adsense Ads will be uncompleted until your blog get a good traffic at least 80-100 visitors per day, for more details you must check this post `<a href="http://harkuchh.com/time-to-apply-for-adsense/" target="_blank">What is the minimum requirement of Adsense</a>`.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">10.       Paid Traffic</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">People use some cheap ways to get traffic on their site one of the most common example is ‘Buying Traffic’, but Dear if you have a wish to earn from best Ads Company, you strictly avoid those cheap things because it might led to disapproval of your Adsense application, and yeah don’t think you are smart and you can make Google fool ! Instead there are many <a href="http://harkuchh.com/how-to-increase-website-blog-traffic-and-ranking/" target="_blank">ways to get massive traffic to your blog</a>.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">11.        Avoid Shortcuts, use Complete Words &amp; Sentences in Paragraphs</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">We have already discussed about `Quality and Type of Content` but I also wanted to tell my Readers that you must use proper completed sentences with formation of paragraphs after an interval interval, this is recommended by Adsense and avoiding it’s ‘Content Type’ criteria may led to disapproval of your Adsense application.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;">12.        Privacy Policy</span></strong></h4>
<span style="font-family: georgia;">You must have <a href="http://harkuchh.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Privacy</a> policy on your blog, it gives a Professional touch to your blog. It can mention in any way, you can place this page with Titles ‘Privacy policy’ or ‘Terms and conditions’. Google says you must focus tio provide best service to your audience and all the readers and ignoring this may became a reason of disapproval of your Adsense Application, then why to take a chance.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia;">I have discussed all the important points and possible ways and it will help you to get an Approved Adsense for sure, now if you have any confusion, query, or point regarding it, please let me know via comment. It will be like an honor to interact with you.</span>
