    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This gonna be a long post, but I bet you won&rsquo;t want to miss a single word. Krishan tried to convince me to break it into 4 different posts by giving multiple references from all his blogging &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; (here&rsquo;s a pun if you can get it), but I din&rsquo;t agree. Quality of content is more important imo.</p>

<p>Here I am telling best of the tricks I use to get what I want from Google. They are fun. If you have some more you think I should know, please mention in comments. Enjoy!</p>

<!-- more    -->


<h2>Exclude all results of a website</h2>

<p>So many times we need to search something but results from some spammy website clutter all search results. Search with following query to remove results from a particular website</p>

<blockquote><p> -site:&ldquo;spamy_site_name.com&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>e.g</p>

<blockquote><p> big bang theory episode -site:youtube.com</p></blockquote>

<p>Above query will remove all results of youtube.com.</p>

<h3>How it work</h3>

<p>You know already if would have read my last post about Google Syntax. There are two things working here.</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;&ndash;"<br/>
The minus(&lsquo;&ndash;&rsquo;) sign tells google to exclude results of the query directly after it.</li>
<li>site:<br/>
This tells google the website to be excluded</li>
</ul>


<h2>Direct download anything</h2>

<p>We all love downloading free music, right? But discovering music has become a tedious task with all those spam sites punching ads in our faces.<br/>
Here&rsquo;s a trick to get to direct links of songs on a website. Search for the following query and replace desired fields to get direct links (most of the time):</p>

<blockquote><p>intitle:&ldquo;index of&rdquo; mp3 wadali brothers</p></blockquote>

<p>You can replace anything after and including &lsquo;mp3&rsquo;.<br/>
In my school days I created a bot to download porn using this technique. I had one hell of a porn collection back then. I still curse me for deleting it :&ndash;/</p>

<h3>How it work</h3>

<p>This trick uses the fact that people on Internet are not actually all smart. There are pretty stupid people around here.</p>

<p>What we are actually doing here is that we are not searching for any pages created by site developer, but for the default pages which server generates for filesystem access over Http. Don&rsquo;t worry if you didn&rsquo;t get it.</p>

<p>Try opening something like &ldquo;file:///&rdquo;. There is no web page over there, but your browser might be showing you a list of files. This is exactly what we are searching for, a page with direct access to the folder on server where &lsquo;mp3&rsquo; are saved.</p>

<h3>Beware of spam</h3>

<p>I am not the only one who know this trick. Spammers know it very well too. This query will work without a glitch for uncommon terms (like &lsquo;wadali brothers&rsquo;) which are not very popular. But if you search for something remotely famous (or too general like hindi songs), you will find herds of spam sites rolling on your site.</p>

<h3>Detect spam</h3>

<p>How can you differentiate b/w spam page and real page you are looking for?<br/>
Well, as I said, we are not actually looking for any page at all. So if you see anything stylish (like colors, styles, ads, sidebars), it&rsquo;s not a real page. Real thing we are looking for do not have anything but white background, black text, blue links (violet visited links), a header and an untitled list. Nothing more.</p>

<h3>How to Avoid spam</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use the previous technique of excluding all results from a website</strong><br/>
Just keep adding <code>-site:spamsite.com</code> for every spam site you don&rsquo;t want to see.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid too general queries</strong><br/>
Try to search for something specific like the song name or singer name. It works to a limit though. If you are searching for something very popular, spam is there waiting for you.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Download books and documents</h2>

<p>This one is my favorite. I read a lot of books. So of course I download a lot of them. This technique can actually be used to download any kind of document available in some specific file extension.</p>

<blockquote><p>ext:pdf how to think like computer scientist python</p></blockquote>

<p>And there you get direct links to the pdf file. You can replace &lsquo;pdf&rsquo; with &lsquo;doc&rsquo;,&lsquo;odf&rsquo;,&lsquo;epub&rsquo; or any other format. You will likely meet less spam in this dimension, but there are times when you&rsquo;ll not find a book. Publicly available free books will generally be there though.</p>

<h3>How it work</h3>

<p>It search for files with specific file extension. Duh! How else it might be working?</p>

<h2>View public cameras</h2>

<p>You can search cameras which have public access. I mean you can get access to the video stream of some publicly available video cameras. Sometimes there are controls available as well for controlling cameras.</p>

<p>You can look through cameras placed in many places like traffic lights, shopping stores, offices and even home cameras sometime.
You need to search for special queries for this. They are kinda hard to remember, so even I&rsquo;ve made a list of those queries.</p>

<h3>How it work</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s same technique as &lsquo;direct download anything&rsquo;. We are searching for some &lsquo;special&rsquo; pages on the net that Google has (by mistake?) crawled.</p>

    <link href="http://harkuchh.com/5-firefox-plugins-i-cant-live-without/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-16T08:01:47+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harkuchh.com/5-firefox-plugins-i-cant-live-without</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use Firefox as my primary web browser. I have emotional attachments with Mozilla and their <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/">mission</a>. I used Chrome for sometime, but I ditched it for some reasons. Firefox make me feel more like home. The philosophical bond of trust is a big thing for me.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of top 5 Firefox addons I use daily. Whenever I switch to a new machine, installing these is generally the first thing I do.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fxchrome">FxChrome</a></h3>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/b7MQxEu.png" alt="FxChrome Firefox plugin" />
FxChrome is a Chrome like theme for Firefox. Firefox is cool, but it doesn&rsquo;t look that cool. By default I mean. This theme make Firefox look like Chrome, while keeping all Mozilla goodness.</p>

<h3><a href="https://wappalyzer.com/">Wappalyzer</a></h3>

<p>Wappalyzer is a browser extension that identifies the technologies used on websites. Whenever I see a good site, first thing that come to mind is what technologies are these guys using?</p>

<p>Wappalyzer save me a lot of work. It shows the technologies used by the sites in the address bar. So whenever I visit a website, it tells me things like they are using Wordpress, jQuery, Google Analytics and other technologies.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a></h3>

<p>Ghostery is for my paranoid self. It stop websites from tracking me. Ghostery detects and stop all sort of trackers used on websites, from analytics to social media widgets. I used to use AdBlock Plus as well earlier, but now I use Ghostery only.<br/>
After all ads are the reason why content on Internet is free. Ghostery protects my privacy while I am still able to support publishers.</p>

<h3><a href="http://trac.arantius.com/wiki/Extensions/Resurrect">Resurrect Pages</a></h3>

<p>Web pages go down all the time. It happen a lot with me that I visit some website and it&rsquo;s down. Resurrect pages help resurrecting the dead (pages) using various archiving sites of the web. Whenever I visit a dead page, it shows a list of archives, and I can choose to visit a snapshot of the page from there.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.pushbullet.com">PushBullet</a></h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ll understand the value of PushBullet only if you use the PushBullet app on your Android phone. PushBullet help me share content between my phone and my browser. I send all sort of things with it to my phone, would it be the todo list of things I need to do when I go out of my home (that actually happen very rarely), or links to articles I want to read on phone when lying in bed or notes etc.</p>

<p>And for some reason my brain start producing awesome ideas when I am about to sleep, and there is no time to start my computer to note them. Then I just start my phone, and send those ideas to my computer as notes. It&rsquo;s a really useful app.</p>

    <link href="http://harkuchh.com/five-reasons-for-why-you-should-learn-programming/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-07T23:47:12+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harkuchh.com/five-reasons-for-why-you-should-learn-programming</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I am writing about why every blogger (and every person in general) should learn to code. Programming as itself is an asset that will make you a better and smarter person. Most important benefit you&rsquo;ll get is the ability to make <strong>literate decisions</strong>. You&rsquo;ll learn how to break down that large problem you are facing, and how to solve it&rsquo;s one piece at a time. Besides, it gives ou great level of confidence.<br/>
Here are five reasons to convince you to learn programming.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>You want to be a God</h2>

<p>I heard yea! So you wanna be a God? Well, you can be actually. Programmers are mini Gods who create little worlds with their programs and control everything. Literally. It&rsquo;s hard to understand this feeling without really experiencing it. But the ultimate control building a software offers is addictive. I myself was a gaming addict in my school time, and now gaming addiction is turned into coding addiction.</p>

<p>The amount of automation you can put in your daily work truly make you feel like a God. It makes me feel real good when I see my script running and think my code can do in 30 minutes what my peers at harkuchh would have taken 4-5 days.</p>

<h2>One blogger who know coding equals ten average bloggers</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get hyper. Let me explain why. Programming skills are valuable in every field directly or remotely related to computers and internet off course.I mean your programming skills become specially important in fields which are completely dependent on computers and Internet. Blogging is such a case. I joined Harkuchh &ndash; The Blogging Valley about a month ago, and the technological improvements we&rsquo;ve made here improved our productivity while brought down the expenses. Although many things are under experiment phase, the time we&rsquo;ve saved so far which would have been wasted in trying things which don&rsquo;t bring any profit is enormous.</p>

<p>To give an example, consider data gathering. We all need to collect data from various sources, many times it involve just copy pasting data from some other source. We&rsquo;ve built a software to automate such things, and saved days of work.</p>

<p>But there are more benefits than I can describe here. Enough benefits that Krishan Kummar (founder of harkuchh.com) is learning to code. (We are thinking about starting giving programming classes to bloggers. Please comment or mail us if you are interested).</p>

<h2>Dream, Believe, Achieve</h2>

<p>These quotes all seem too good to be practical in real world. This might be true, but not in the world where you can even be a God. You just wish if there was a software which would do <em>something awesome here</em>, and you roll out your emacs (or your favorite editor), and voila! It&rsquo;s there. Anything is possible, all you need to do is to believe in your wit and skills. Sounds too good to be real? Welcome to the world of programmers :)</p>

<h2>It teaches you to make better decisions in life</h2>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t emphasize how beneficial it is for anyone (including you bloggers) to have some programming skills. Even if you don&rsquo;t become a wiz, acquaintance with programming is a very much helpful. When you don&rsquo;t know anything about how your websites and software are actually working under-the-hood, you are like riding a bike eye-folded. You either hit a tree or something, or you go too slow.</p>

<p>Most important benefit you&rsquo;ll get is the ability to make <strong>literate decisions</strong>. You&rsquo;ll learn how to break down that large problem you are facing, and how to solve it&rsquo;s one piece at a time. Besides, it give you great level of confidence. When you think of a crazy idea, and you have good programming skills under your belt, you quickly analyze all the steps which you&rsquo;ll need to take to make that awesome thing. You carry this habit to your real life. And suddenly all things become simple, because you&rsquo;ll quickly analyze everything and sort out plans for doing things which seem impossible or very hard to others. It&rsquo;ll give you a new perspective in your career, as well as in your life.</p>

<h2>Programming is fun, and it makes you smarter</h2>

<p>I ditched gaming for coding, not because it give me money, but simply because it&rsquo;s more fun. I still play games once in a while when I want my brain to relax, but I&rsquo;m yet to find a game which&rsquo;ll give me more thrill than coding. If you follow the right steps (like choose right first language, right teacher, right things to do in your first steps in coding world), programming is like playing a very powerful computer game. Projects you do are your highscore and skills you gain are your reward, that&rsquo;ll stay with you for rest of your life. Besides, remember all your kids (the next generation) will be taught coding in schools like we are taught poems, then your children will ask you questions related to coding, what you gonna do then? ;)</p>

    <link href="http://harkuchh.com/strong-passwords-weak-passwords-how-to-generate-strongest-possible-passwords-which-you-can-remember/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-04T00:46:09+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harkuchh.com/strong-passwords-weak-passwords-how-to-generate-strongest-possible-passwords-which-you-can-remember</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Passwords we know, the most common method used by almost all websites for authenticating users. But how good is this method? Well, the strength of this method partially depend on the strength of the password we choose.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What&rsquo;s the strength of a password?</h2>

<p>Strength of a password is determined by a number of things.
* <strong>Character set</strong><br/>
Most important thing which make a password strong is its character set. Character set of a password means which characters are used in the password, like lower case characters, upper case characters, numbers, symbols etc. A password which has all different type of characters is considered stronger.
* <strong>Length of the password</strong><br/>
Second most important thing about strong passwords is their length. Longer passwords are considered more secure.
* <strong>Guessability of the password</strong><br/>
Another thing which determine strength of password is of easy it is to guess a password. Easier to guess passwords are weak. A security researcher has said that <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/03/only-secure-password-is-one-you-cant.html">any password  you can remember is not safe enough</a>.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p> So we have a problem here. They say any password we choose which we can remember is not safe enough. Most people choose easy, simple to remember password, which is perfectly reasonable. Why putting extra load on brain? But this laziness can cost more than you think.</p>

<h2><a href="http://channikhabra.github.io/fireword/">The Solution</a></h2>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ujh8L6y.png" alt="Fireword password generator" /><br/>
 So I wanted a system which will create passwords for me which I can remember, but which can&rsquo;t be guessed or cracked easily. One solution to this is passphrases. For example, instead of choosing a single word password like &ldquo;facebook123&rdquo;, I choose a sentence like &ldquo;facebookhasbluecolor&rdquo;. And even better, change some character with symbols and numbers, &ldquo;f@c3b00kh4sBlu3C0lOr&rdquo;. Awesome, right! But it still can be remembered. So according to our theory that any password which can be remembered is not safe enough. I want something simple to remember and type and still very strong and long.
 So being a software developer, I made a system which do exactly this. I call it fireword.</p>

<h2>What is fireword?</h2>

<p> <a href="http://channikhabra.github.io/fireword/">Fireword</a> is an application in which you enter a simple word or phrase, and it give you a very strong and impossible to guess password.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://channikhabra.github.io/fireword/">Fireword</a> always generate same password for same word. So you remember your simple password, and generate a strong one with this site. And then when you need to login again, regenerate strong password with your simple one.</li>
<li><a href="http://channikhabra.github.io/fireword/">Fireword</a> allow you to select the length of the password. You can choose from 8 to 128 character long password.</li>
<li>For example, just entering &lsquo;facebook&rsquo; become this &lsquo;bF2A37d5e8%{61?C]>3E[{(9{&rsquo;. Any password can be expanded to at most 128 character long complex password.

<h2>Recommended ways to use <a href="http://channikhabra.github.io/fireword/">Fireword</a></h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s really simple. Instead of using you easy to remember but weak password for a website, change your password with the password generated by fireword.</p></li>
<li>Enter your simple password in <a href="http://channikhabra.github.io/fireword/">Fireword</a>, get a strong one, and use it for logging in.</li>
<li>Do not copy-paste strong generated passwords on your hard-disk, it is very insecure. Instead, whenever you need to login again, just get back to the fireword, and generate password again. <a href="http://channikhabra.github.io/fireword/">Fireword</a> will always generate same strong password for same simple password you enter.

<h2>How to choose passwords?</h2></li>
<li>Instead of choosing ridiculously stupid passwords like &lsquo;password&rsquo;, you should choose little smarter passwords. Even if you are hardening your passwords with fireword, try choosing a better password.</li>
<li>Choose different passwords for different sites following some pattern, like</li>
<li>Use the name of the website for which you are generating password and use some words in front and end of it. Like
<strong> For facebook choose bluefacebookaccount
</strong> For google choose greengoogleaccount
<strong> Come up with your own patterns. You can even use your phone number, your name and the site name in the combo.
</strong> Convert the pattern with fireword, and get strongest password possible.
Amazing. Isn&rsquo;t it!<br/>
<strong>NOTE: Firefox and Chrome extensions are on their way. With them you&rsquo;ll not even need to visit firewordgen.herokuapp.com.</strong></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Top level domain which is also abbrebiated as TLD is the very last segment of any domain name, every domain&rsquo;s last part is simply called as TLD. The TLD is the letters immediately following the final dot in an Internet address i.e. any website url, for Instance in Harkuchh.com here .com is TLD of generic class (we will talk about TLD classes below). Most generally TLD is use to identifies something about a website is associated with, like its purpose, the organization that owns it or the geographical area from where it has originates, and every type of TLD has a different registry which is being maintained by a designated organization the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) under the direction of ICANN i.e. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.</p>

<p>
To better understand TLD see our Internet address which is, <a href="http://Harkuchh.com">http://Harkuchh.com</a> now here com is the top-level domain name and Harkuchh is the second-level domain name and if a domain has anything even before second level domain then it is called as a subdomain. When these all merge together they build a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) the addition of <a href="HTTP://">HTTP://</a> makes an FQDN a complete URL.</p>

<h2><strong>Four (4) major categories of TLDs</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Generic top-level domains (gTLD)</strong> &mdash; These are the most used, common and familiar type of TLDs. Examples include &ldquo;com&rdquo; for &ldquo;commercial&rdquo;, &ldquo;org&rdquo; for &ldquo;organization&rdquo; and &ldquo;edu&rdquo; for &ldquo;educational.&rdquo; Most generic TLDs are open for everyone to register, but there is a subgroup that is more strictly controlled and that is not used broadly.</p>

<p><strong>Country-code top-level domains (ccTLD)</strong> &mdash; Each ccTLD identifies a particular country and every ccTLD is two letters long, for example we can see the ccTLD for India is .in and for United States is .us.</p>

<p><strong>Infrastructure top-level domain</strong> &mdash; This type is very often used class of TLD may be that is the reason there is only one TLD in this group, ARPA (Address and Routing Parameter Area). The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) manages this TLD for the IETF.</p>

<p><strong>Sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)</strong>: These are overseen by private organizations.</p>

<p>ICANN Proposed an expansion of the TLD system to allow anyone to register and also reserve any spare unused letter sequence as a TLD for Their exclusive use, in April 2009. For example if a company who use to sell sotwares want to to use .Soft as a TLD then they can use it. According to <strong>ICANN chief executive Paul Levins</strong>, Such an extension would lead to thousands of new TLDs in the coming years.</p>
