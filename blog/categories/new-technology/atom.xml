<h1><span style="font-family: georgia;">Dakhal Looks similar to Facebook</span></h1>


<p>Everybody knows that Facebook is most popular social networking site and people love to use it all the time, so dad-son pair decided to establish a website that give feeling of using Facebook with some more advanced and useful features.</p>

They claim that Dakhal is the <strong>first social networking</strong> <b>website of India</b> offering <strong>Entertainment, Chatting, Jobs</strong> &amp; much more facilities.
<span style="font-family: georgia;">
</span></span></p>

<h1><span style="font-family: georgia;">Contents in Dakhal.in</span></h1>


<p>Chatting is the soul of any social networking website and so it is must, They knew it very well so they provided easy chatting controls they also decided to add more information and features which are necessary for Indian citizens.

<p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><em><strong>Note :</strong></em> There is no official measurement for memory unit size after Yottabyte yet, but these are suggestions with strong potential, so from now we can say websitebyte is the largest memory unit for digital devices.</span></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">There are more than enough websites over internet who tells the a website’s worth, their income, page views, daily traffic, Ads revenues etc and well known example of this type of websites is <strong>Getwebsiteworth.com</strong>, This is a site who tells worth of websites, by tracing some stats of a website.<!--more--></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">I’m very sure that, You Guys have also checked your website worth on some websites like this many time and became happy after knowing the worth of your website, but the thing I’m going to tell you through this post will make your a lil bit sad for sure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">All these kind of websites who shows estimated cost of a website are non-Trustable, I mean don’t trust on any of them, now you may surely wanted to ask <code>but why I don’t believe on Getwebsiteworth ?</code> right ! oh yeah I’m sure you wanted to ask this, so here are the points..</span></p>

<div style="height: 440px; width: 600px; float: left; background: #F0F0F0;">
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">All these websites who tell value of a website are also a particular website and they want traffic on their site same like we want on our website, and for this they make people fool.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">These websites trace some data of our website from internet which are easily available for anyone like Alexa ranking and search engine health of our website.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">After fetching these data from internet they estimate worth of our website by following some Algorithms.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">The worth is calculated by taking the average of ranking, SEO properties, search engine visibility etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">On the basis of those records, they produce fake calculated worth and other result like Pageviews and ads revenues.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">Even after they show clearly fake information &amp; result on their sites, people go heavily crowded to these sites on regular interval for checking whether worth of their site increased or not, they feel happy to see their website’s worth but they are unaware of the fact that, they have been tricked and these website making people nothing more than fool and they don’t want any occasion like April fool for this.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em style="color: #000000; font-family: georgia;"><strong>Note</strong> </em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: georgia;">: I’m not talking about Getwebsiteworth.com only instead I’m talking about all those websites who shows worth of a website.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">I know still many people not ready to believe on me and  my words, no problem it’s human tendency to not believe on true things they love to be sticked with those things which make them smile no matter those things are genuine or not, but no worries I have a proof.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">If you are also one of those category people then in next few lines you will start believing on me, here is the proof why I’m telling you to not believe on Getwebsiteworth.com or any of this type of website.</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;"><strong>First of all see this picture..</strong></span></h4>


<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_6011&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;479&rdquo;]<a href="http://harkuchh.com/why-i-dont-believe-on-websites-like-getwebsiteworth/is-getwebsiteworth-com-a-trustable-site-no/" rel="attachment wp-att-6011"><img class="size-full wp-image-6011" title="is Getwebsiteworth.com a trustable site, No !" alt="" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/is-Getwebsiteworth.com-a-trustable-site-No-.jpg" width="479" height="441" /></a> snapshot taken last week from <strong>Getwebsiteworth</strong>[/caption]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">This is great, isn’t it. According to this record my website Harkuchh.Com having 46,608 daily pageviews this is kind of joke for me you know why, because actual daily pageviews of my website is average 6-8K&hellip; Wait wait don’t laugh yet I’ve one joke to crack here which make you laugh harder, according to Getwebsteworth my Daily Ads Revenue is $196 :D and you know what, Harkuchh.Com’s actual daily ads revenues is less than $10 till today. Hehehehe&hellip;.. <a href="http://harkuchh.com/google-is-a-girl-i-can-prove-it/biggrin/" rel="attachment wp-att-5324"><img title="Kamina Hansi" alt="" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/biggrin.gif" width="16" height="16" /></a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #000000;">Now see the difference where is $196 and where it stands on $10, now I think I don’t need to explain it anymore, you guys are smart and most probably having your own brain inside your skull (tell me if you don’t :P ) so now you are going to believe on these kind of stuff  in future ! comment if you liked it.</span></p>

    <link href="http://harkuchh.com/google-is-a-girl-i-can-prove-it/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-19T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harkuchh.com/google-is-a-girl-i-can-prove-it</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: #000000;">Is Google male or Female ? Funny question, right ! oh yeah it’s funny, but you will be amazed if I tell you that many people over Internet consistently searching for answer of this question, when I saw it first I was also amazed but my brain took no time for remembering me a line which I read once on <a href="http://harkuchh.com/category/fb/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">facebook</span></a> that <code>On the Internet you can be anything you want, it’s strange that so many people choose to be stupid</code>.<!--more--></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: #000000;"><a href="http://harkuchh.com/google-is-a-girl-i-can-prove-it/google-is-girl-proof-here/" rel="attachment wp-att-5323"><span style="color: #000000;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5323" title="google is girl, proof here" alt="" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/google-is-girl-proof-here.jpg" width="352" height="256" /></span></a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: #000000;">Now if many people searching for <a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">Google</span></a> is a girl or boy, then it’s our duty to provide reliable and best results to them, after all we are bloggers :) so here I’m with the results and I’m damn sure that after reading this post you will salute me, so without wasting time let&rsquo;s start now..</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: #000000;"><strong>1.</strong>  Google is a Girl because it won&rsquo;t let you complete the whole sentence, and without knowing what you exactly want it start guessing &amp; suggesting not even only this it also happens that you ask only one question but get hundreds of irrelevant answers in seconds it often gives good but sometimes humorous suggestions and the world knows <a href="http://harkuchh.com/what-the-things-guys-like-in-a-girl/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">ladies</span></a> can&rsquo;t survive without these thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: #000000;"><strong>2.</strong> All bloggers will be fully agree with this point, Google is a girl because generally it happen that a girl refuse again and again to a boy for friendship by giving different reasons but if the guy keep on trying then girl start thinking and if she realise that the boy is not bad then most probably she accept the proposal, same thing do google in case of Adsense, it&rsquo;s true think of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: #000000;"><strong>3.</strong> I call Google a girl because it <a href="http://harkuchh.com/time-to-apply-for-adsense/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">Advertising</span></a> too much for itself and also advertises others matters and certainly it’s one of the most special trait of women caste.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: #000000;"><strong>4.</strong> You will find people rarely who don’t like girls and same like that it’s not easy to find people who don’t like using Google for search operation, now if you’re going to tell me <code>Dude people also use Yahoo, Bing, Msn etc instead of google</code> then don’t forget there are also some people exist who strictly avoid girls, don’t believe me ! just come to my college and meet Narhar <a href="http://harkuchh.com/google-is-a-girl-i-can-prove-it/hehehe/" rel="attachment wp-att-5325"><span style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5325" title="Hehehe" alt="" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Hehehe.gif" width="16" height="16" /></span></a> afterall exception is everywhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: #000000;"><strong>5.</strong> Google is a girl because it’s good and holy place for those who use Internet for just  educational stuff, research material, various info etc but there is also another aspect that google provides material which satisfy a horny man :-P  same like that a girl is very good for all but she do all those naughty things for her man.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: #000000;"><strong>6.</strong> Only a girl is capable of giving real pleasure to a man which other options can never give, those things can give partial satisfaction not pleasure same like that Google gives the best results which make seeker fully satisfied.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: #000000;"><strong>7.</strong> This is funny but true Google can be called a girl because once we start relationship with google (<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">analytics</span></a>) it keeps all records about our product whether it’s a website or blog it keep tracking who visited our blog, how many pages a visitor saw, how much time they spend there etc and a girl always aware of what her man is doing.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: #000000;"><strong>8.</strong> It is rarely seen when a girl actually sits quite, I was very amazed when once I read somewhere that `The Japanese have developed a camera with a shutter so fast, it can actually capture a photo of female with her mouth closed :P and it also happens less than once in years when Google become quite and stop giving results.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: #000000;"><strong>9.</strong> Google is a perfect female because the home page looks greatly simple but its reach on the web is so deep same like a Woman might look shallow but the heart of a woman is as deep as the ocean as said in blockbuster <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">Titanic</span></a> movie.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: #000000;"><strong>10.</strong> Best reason for topic Google is a girl, and here it is, On special occasions a girl decorates herself very elegantly and looks very pretty and different than normal days, and you must have seen the various ways google write it’s name on the site on Christmas, <a href="http://harkuchh.com/happy-new-year-2013-wishes-pics-wallpapers-and-fb-cover/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">New year</span></a>, Valentines etc and it also looks very nice and different.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
