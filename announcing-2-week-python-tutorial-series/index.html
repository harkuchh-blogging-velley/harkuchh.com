<p>Few days back we shared our experience about how we utilize the Python programming language at harkuchh. We got very positive response about it and readers requested tutorials about the Python programming language.</p>

<p>So here I am with the announcement of the python tutorial series on harkcuhh.com.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>2 week tutorial series</h3>

<p>I have drafted a roadmap for a tutorial of 2 weeks. That is I will publish tutorials for learning Python from ground up and continue for 2 weeks. There will be 14 tutorials, one for each day.</p>

<p>We will start with a very gentle introduction to the Python programming language, and will raise the bar with every tutorial. We will discuss the general programming problems which are taught in most programming classes, just to showcase how easy it is to do same things with Python. If you are brand new to the world of programming, don&rsquo;t worry; you are actually the intended reader of these tutorials.</p>

<blockquote><p>Programming is heavily under-rated in our city Chandigarh. Tech scene in the city is daunting. No enthusiastic community, no user groups, and dominance of PHP. It&rsquo;s a nightmare. This should change.</p></blockquote>

<h3>How much time you should give to the tutorial?</h3>

<p>If you are brand new to programming, 30 to 60 minutes for every tutorial should be enough. Give as much time as you need to understand the concepts demonstrated in each tutorial.</p>

<h3>What if I don&rsquo;t get anything?</h3>

<p>Ask us. This is a blog right! So there is a comment box under every post. Besides, we also have <a href="http://harkuchh.com/forums">forums</a>. I recommend you to create a post there. It will be helpful for others as well.</p>

<h3>I don&rsquo;t like reading. Can you provide a video?</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the Youtube <a href="http://youtube.com/">channel we&rsquo;ve created for tutorials on harkuchh</a>.</p>
