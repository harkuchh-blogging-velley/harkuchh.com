Last few years showed really a tremendous growth in blogging field,  millions of blog have been started by the young generation. Youth loving blogging field because of two main reasons, money or passion or both. blogging doesn&#8217;t require any writers and contributors who know a lot about HTML, PHP or any coding language.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;"> </span>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333333;"><em><strong>Common Reasons for the Popularity of Blogging</strong></em></span></h3>

<hr />

<span style="color: #333333;"><strong> </strong></span>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>1. Passion for writing</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333333;">I saw passion of writing  in many of my friends and i feel writing is a common passion or like a hobby for many youngsters and They need some perfect platform to innovate this writing passion so that they can use it in right area and help others by their tallent. young generation choose blogging as the best platform to give their passion a new way instead of writing it into diaries like old people do.Generally  People of this category just share their knowledge and don’t care much about money or anything.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>2. Money</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Money, it sounds good J Well i think money is one of most important things which attract youth towards blogging, because youth always fell happy to earn their own income during his/her study time (schooling &amp; College). Everybody need money to live a good life, some people also says Money is nothing but I must say may be money is nothing for you but you need money for everything. Even I created my blog for earning Pocket money because I don’t like to please in front of my parents for my pocket money. but<em><strong> never think money is the fruits for your hard deeds but to earn these fruits, you need to show dedicated efforts. Always remember good things takes time.</strong></em></span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>3. Fame &amp; Reputation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333333;">These two words Fame &amp; Reputation really means a lot for everyone. I can’t imagine that  someone hate these two things in life. I am damn sure we all like Fame and Reputation so this is another major reason youth loving blogging, I know many guys and girls who earning money from blogging  and they earn huge Fame and believe me, there is nothing which make you happy more than this when you have Fame and popularity when you are young.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>4. Developing Self Entrepreneur</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Today many youngsters has dream of  developing a  successful Entrepreneur who creates and manage own business. Many  successful and experienced bloggers turned themselves into business brand as they realized that blogging career doesn’t have bright and everlasting future. And they utilized their blogging experience and earned huge success. Today’s youth is looking for same they wish to create their own empire by turning themselves in successful entrepreneur and choose blogging as the first stair of Success.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>5. Socializing</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Majority of people loves to be social and interested in making new friends. When someone achieve success in blogging He/She automatically makes new friends in as  seniors, juniors, followers, fans and clients etc. So blogging  provide perfect way for youngsters to expand their social group which help them for getting new ideas because everyone has something unique in his mind.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>6. No (Boss, Tension, Pressure, Rules, conditions) &amp; No timing</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Many times we hear from people around us that ‘He was fired by his Boss’, ‘I leave the Job because Boss was very crucial’, ‘Boss was not a good person’ ‘Boss always use cheap language and talk rudely’ means people don’t get respect even after full day hard work, Blogging is something outstanding  in this criteria because if you are a blogger there is no boss ready to kick on your ass for work, no tension, no pressure, no rules, no any terms and conditions and specially no timing for you, You can work when you have time and you can leave whenever you want you don’t have to wait till approval of application. <em><strong> Be your own Boss :)</strong></em> .</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>7. Knowledge</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333333;">We know Today’s Youth has boiling blood and they consistently searching for knowledge so as to improve their skills and blogging is the perfect place where they can improve their skills. If you owning a blog, then you definitely going to read out more and more to sharpen your language, skills, working method, accuracy etc. So knowledge hunt is another factor which attracts the young generation towards blogging.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>8.Experience:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Experience is something which really matter everywhere, because we know, a more experienced person makes less mistakes in work. So youth wish to accumulate more and more experience. And they also don’t like to shamed by anyone so Blogging Blogging is the platform where if one performs infinite mistakes he gain knowledge and learn something new not being fired by the boss.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong> 9. Confidence</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333333;">If one person is a good blogger and following by a huge traffic and earning good money  then obviously he carry more confidence than someone who completed their degree by reading the books. Because more practical information makes anyone more sharper, more confident.</span></p>
