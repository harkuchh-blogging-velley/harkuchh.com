While talking I said him that, “on this website we’ll need to do same thing again and again hundreds of time and it will take lots of our time and effort :(“. Then he said “Don’t worry dude, I’ll make a script that will automate all this thing and then you will need to do that only once and rest will be done by the script.”</p><p>I was surprised and like, is it possible? He said “Yeah dude, it’s simple and will not take too long to be developed” then I told him to do it fast, and I started writing a post on my movie blog and when I published only one post He said “Done bro! here it is.”</p><p>I said “seriously, will it do all those things which I was talking about?” I got the best reply, it was ‘off course!’.</p><p>I said let’s see, and unbelievably it done all those things in just minutes, any person who have no knowledge of coding and programming will never believe that the things which required at least 1 week day and night work was done in just minutes. I was shocked! and said to my friend, “Awesome bro, how did you do it”, he replied “Python bro, it’s awesome”.</p><p>Till then I just knew that Python is a programming language but I didn’t know anything about its working or coding. Actually I didn’t know any coding or programming language. Not even C++ in which I spent all four years of my B.tech degree.</p><p>So when I heard Python, I didn’t take even a second to say, “bro! can’t I learn Python?”</p><p>“Of course you can”, he said. “But you will need to be regular on it”, he added.</p><p>I replied joyfully “of course I will, it will be great if I can do things in minute(s) for which I give hours, days and even weeks to complete, so let’s start it now.”</p><p>He said No! We will start it from tommorow, let me prepare modules and a structure for teaching Python in the best way to you. And next day we started.</p><p>And now, just after a week.. Even I cannot believe that now I can do many things with my own created crawlers which none of you can do even in weeks, please note, I’m not showing off here but I’m just trying to tell, how much difference simple coding are able to create.</p><p>Let me share an example with you so that you can get my words better, previously I used to copy contents of events websites manually in which I needed to..</p><ul><li><p>Go to a website</p></li><li><p>Open a post</p></li><li><p>Create a new text file (to copy post)</p></li><li><p>Copy posts title from that website</p></li><li><p>Paste that into text file</p></li><li><p>Copy body of the post</p></li><li><p>Paste that into text file again</p></li><li><p>Copy keywords, description and tags from source code</p></li><li><p>Paste them into text file</p></li></ul><p>…and these all steps were required for every post and imagine if there were 100 posts on that site it simply means I needed to do these all things 100 times to get everything in my hand, most of you are doing same, I know. But..</p><p>today, I just take some minutes to create a crawler for any specific website and run it, after that crawler do all the rest thing in minutes. Any non technical person will never believe that, it copies posts at the rate of 500-600/minute with proper distinguish between every part of the post which includes title, body, images, keywords, tags, description, category and all related information which I think I require and I told, to to do same thing manually I required at least 2-3 days.</p><p>So this is the difference and that all is possible with a simple effort to learn python. That is why I’m learning Python.</p></div><footer><p class="meta"><span class="byline author vcard">Posted by <span class="fn">Krishan Kumar - </span></span><time datetime="2014-02-11T23:16:11+05:30" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 11<span>th</span>, 2014</time></p><div class="sharing"> <a href="//twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="http://harkuchh.com/why-i-am-learning-python/" data-via="" data-counturl="http://harkuchh.com/why-i-am-learning-python/">Tweet</a><div class="g-plusone" data-size="medium"></div><div class="fb-like" data-send="true" data-width="450" data-show-faces="false"></div></div><p class="meta"> <a class="basic-alignment left" href="/five-reasons-for-why-you-should-learn-programming/" title="Previous Post: Five reasons why every blogger should learn programming">« Five reasons why every blogger should learn programming</a> <a class="basic-alignment right" href="/why-bloggers-need-to-save-themselves-from-google-lesson-we-got-after-losing-400k/" title="Next Post: Why bloggers need to save themselves from Google: Lesson we got after losing 400K">Why bloggers need to save themselves from Google: Lesson we got after losing 400K »</a></p> </footer> </article><section><h1>Comments</h1><div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript></div> </section></div><aside class="sidebar"> <section><h1>Recent Posts</h1><ul id="recent_posts"><li class="post"> <a href="/5-firefox-plugins-i-cant-live-without/">5 Firefox Plugins I Can't Live Without</a></li><li class="post"> <a href="/why-bloggers-need-to-save-themselves-from-google-lesson-we-got-after-losing-400k/">Why Bloggers Need to Save Themselves From Google: Lesson We Got After Losing 400K</a></li><li class="post"> <a href="/why-i-am-learning-python/">Why I Am Learning Python</a></li><li class="post"> <a href="/five-reasons-for-why-you-should-learn-programming/">Five Reasons Why Every Blogger Should Learn Programming</a></li><li class="post"> <a href="/strong-passwords-weak-passwords-how-to-generate-strongest-possible-passwords-which-you-can-remember/">Strong Passwords, Weak Passwords: How to Generate Strongest Possible Passwords Which You Can Remember</a></li></ul> </section> </aside></div></div> <footer role="contentinfo"><p> Copyright © 2014 - harkuchh</p></footer><script>var disqus_shortname="harkuchh",disqus_identifier="http://harkuchh.com/why-i-am-learning-python/",disqus_url="http://harkuchh.com/why-i-am-learning-python/",disqus_script="embed.js";!function(){var e=document.createElement("script");e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.src="//"+disqus_shortname+".disqus.com/"+disqus_script,(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0]).appendChild(e)}()</script><div id="fb-root"></div> <script>!function(e,n,t){var a,c=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];e.getElementById(t)||(a=e.createElement(n),a.id=t,a.async=!0,a.src="//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#appId=212934732101925&xfbml=1",c.parentNode.insertBefore(a,c))}(document,"script","facebook-jssdk")</script><script>!function(){var e=document.createElement("script");e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.src="https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js";var t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)}()</script><script>!function(){var t=document.createElement("script");t.type="text/javascript",t.async=!0,t.src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js",document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(t)}()</script></body></html>
