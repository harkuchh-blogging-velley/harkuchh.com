<div class="entry-content">To make decent money in Blogging the thing which every blogger needs more than anything else is <b>huge traffic to the blog</b>. We all are the bloggers and we know, every blogger, writer or webmaster wish to get more and <b>more traffic to their blog</b>, because it’s a simple formula i.e. <b>more audiences means more money</b>. I’ve seen many Bloggers doing very hard job on their blogs but still they won’t get the remarkable traffic to their blogs and I noticed generally they won’t pay their attention to <b>Back link building </b>and if you tell them to <b>generate backlinks</b> they thinks that we are asking them to <b>buy back links </b>because<b> </b>they don’t know the proper way to <b>building back links</b>, if you are one of them then must read this post at least twice because if you get it properly it will be the the best <b>SEO help </b>for you, forever<a href="http://bing.com" target="_blank">.</a><a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank">.</a><!--more-->
<h1><b>What are Back links ?</b></h1>
<strong>Backlinks</strong> enable the reader to keep track of some other pages on the web which is linked to the current post they are reading, let’s make it easy with an example, suppose I’ve written a post about <a href="http://harkuchh.com/tag/adsense/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Google Adsense</strong></span></a> on my blog and then you come to my blog and read that post, you finds it interesting, then you goes to your own blog and writes a post inspired by my post and you link your post with my original post from where you took the idea (remember giving credit is necessary). Now my post will automatically show that you has linked to it, and it will provide a short snippet of my text and a link to my post, that is the reason why in <b>seo backlink</b> plays a very important role.

<a href="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/What-are-the-Back-links-and-How-to-Build-Back-Links.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8894" alt="What are the Back links and How to Build Back Links" src="http://harkuchh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/What-are-the-Back-links-and-How-to-Build-Back-Links.png" width="350" height="263" /></a>
<h2><b>Why Backlink is important ?</b></h2>
<b> </b>Backlink is one of the key factor to get good raputation to your blog as well as <b>buildings backlinks</b> are one of the best, popular and effective ways to <b>get more traffic to any blog or website </b>not only that it is also said that it is the best <b>search engine optimization strategy</b> generating backlinks..

&nbsp;
<h2><b>How to Build Backlinks ?</b></h2>
Well when it comes to building back links there are two <b>ways to generate backlinks for blogs</b> which are the <b>right way to build backlinks</b> and a <b>wrong way to build back links</b>, as it’s very valuable it take efforts but once you&#8217;ve done the right way, soon you will see the traffic coming to your blog.

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Let’s know what are the way to generate backlinks ?</b></h2>
<b> </b>
<h3>The Wrong Way to Build Backlinks</h3>
I know this very well because I also did it when I was new to this field but thankful to the <a href="http://Labnol.org" target="_blank"><strong>Labnol.org</strong></a> I came to know about it very soon and I stopped doing that, but what’s that ? Actually many people especially newbies normally tries to build their back links by the wrong way at one point due to lack of knowledge about it, people generally do not care that the way the are following is a wrong way, even if they knew. The wrong way to create backlink is, go and post your links every where you can, like in comments, social sites, but this is called spamming, by doing this you’re doing nothing more than posting irrelevant links and remember by following this way you will never get <b>quality backlinks</b>, for example you go to YouTube and open one of the Eninem’s video then in comments you post a comment with URL of your post `How to keep keep your Adsense Account Secure` boy by doing this you’re wasting your time because nobody is going click on that link and eventually your link will be removed.

&nbsp;
<h3><b>The Right Way to Build Quality Backlinks</b></h3>
Now you know what mistakes you were doing let’s know the <b>best way to build Quality backlinks</b>, well the right way to do it is Place your links to the relevant places where it would be useful, meaningful and desirable. if you’ll place your links to such pages then it will surely drive traffic to your blog easily. For instance you have written a post `<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://harkuchh.com/justin-biebers-untold-story/" target="_blank"><b>You are small enough to make fun of Justin Bieber</b></a></span>`then you go to some other websites with questions or controversy on Justin Bieber then you leave a relevant relevant comment with the link of your article where you have written something related to the topic like `No, you are wrong, you are making fun of Justin Bieber you’re calling him Gay but you don’t know his power <a href="http://harkuchh.com/justin-biebers-untold-story/" target="_blank">check this out</a> first and then see where you stands`.

&nbsp;

That way when readers will see your that strong &amp; meaningful comment related to the subject they are talking about will surely click on your link to see more information. Believe me this is the <b>best way to build smart referral link</b>. This is great quality of work which is important and when someone comes to that post and really find what they are looking for then most probably you will a potential fan and another reader.

&nbsp;

<b>Note</b> : If you will do it gently then you will never feel requirement of <b>search engine optimization packages</b>, <b>link building service</b><b> </b>for seo of your blog and that is the reason building quality backlinks is called as the <b>best search engine optimization </b>tool and it will let you save the expense of <b>search engine optimization software</b>s because the right way will give you <b>free back links</b>. This is the <b>affordable search engine optimization </b>strategy for everyone, after all it’s free.

Happy Blogging &#8230; :)
